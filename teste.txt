    CHAPTER Vitten in French, and delivered
by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:

â€œIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,
I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10â€”Annette
SchÃ©rer.â€

â€œHeavens! what a virulent attack!â€ replied the prince, not in the
least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an
embroidered coabout NovosÃ­ltsevâ€™s
dispatch? You know everything.â€

â€œWhat can one say about it?â€ replied the prince in a cold, listless
tone. â€œWhat has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has
burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.â€

Prince VasÃ­li always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale
part. Anna PÃ¡vlovna SchÃ©rer on the contrary, despite her forty years,
overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiswer
did NovosÃ­ltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot
understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for
himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they
promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not
perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and
that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I donâ€™t believe a
word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famr she nor
anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was
pleased with.

â€œBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her
sister,â€ was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.

As she named the Empress, Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s face suddenly assumed an
expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deisatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselvesâ€ (and her
face assumed its melancholy expression), â€œhe was mentioned at Her
Majestyâ€™s and you were pitied....â€

The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
awaiting a reply. He frowned.

â€œWhat would you have me do?â€ he said at last. â€œYou know I did all
a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.
Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an actiive years, if he goes on like this?â€ Presently he added: â€œThatâ€™s
what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours
rich?â€

â€œHer father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is
the well-known Prince BolkÃ³nski who had to retire from the army under
the late Emperor, and was nicknamed â€˜the King of Prussia.â€™ He is
very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.
She has a brother; I think you know him, he muring the previous winter, and being pregnant did
not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince
VasÃ­liâ€™s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.
The AbbÃ© Morio and many others had also come.

     * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.

To each new arrival Anna PÃ¡vlovna said, â€œYou have not yet seen my
aunt,â€ or â€œYou do not know my aunt?â€ and very gravely conducted
him or her to a little old lady, wearing la mother, so full of life and health, and
carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones
who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a
little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life
and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile
and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a
specially amiable mood that day.

The little princess went round the table wegitimate son of Count BezÃºkhov, a well-known
grandee of Catherineâ€™s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man
had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only
just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his
first appearance in society. Anna PÃ¡vlovna greeted him with the nod she
accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of
this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the s bent, and his big feet
spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbÃ©â€™s
plan chimerical.

â€œWe will talk of it later,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna with a smile.

And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she
resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready
to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As
the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes
rouwhom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face
was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had
settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round
the abbÃ©. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful
Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s daughter, and the little Princess
BolkÃ³nskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.
The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pand the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest
and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef
on a hot dish.

The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.

â€œCome over here, HÃ©lÃ¨ne, dear,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna to the
beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of
another group.

The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which
she had first entered the roomâ€”th she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time
to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story
produced an effect she glanced at Anna PÃ¡vlovna, at once adopted just
the expression she saw on the maid of honorâ€™s face, and again relapsed
into her radiant smile.

The little princess had also left the tea table and followed HÃ©lÃ¨ne.

â€œWait a moment, Iâ€™ll get my work.... Now then, what are you
thinking of?â€ she went on, turning to Prince Hippohat he only understood the meaning of his words after he
had uttered them.

He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure
whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in
a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
effrayÃ©e, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.

The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,
to the effect that the Duc dâ€™Enghien had gone secretrope and the rights of
the people,â€ the abbÃ© was saying. â€œIt is only necessary for one
powerful nation like Russiaâ€”barbaric as she is said to beâ€”to place
herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the
world!â€

â€œBut how are you to get that balance?â€ Pierre was beginning.

At that moment Anna PÃ¡vlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,
asked the ItaœGeneral KutÃºzov,â€ said BolkÃ³nski, speaking French and stressing
the last syllable of the generalâ€™s name like a Frenchman, â€œhas been
pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....â€

â€œAnd Lise, your wife?â€

â€œShe will go to the country.â€

â€œAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?â€

â€œAndrÃ©,â€ said his wife, addressing her husband in the same
coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, â€œthe vicomte has
been telling us such of her dress, and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,
almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.

â€œVery lovely,â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œVery,â€ said Pierre.

In passing Prince VasÃ­li seized Pierreâ€™s hand and said to Anna
PÃ¡vlovna: â€œEducate this bear for me! He has been staying with me
a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.
Nothing is so necessary for a young man apointment in the Guards for her only son.
It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince VasÃ­li that she had obtained an
invitation to Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s reception and had sat listening to
the vicomteâ€™s story. Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s words frightened her, an
embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;
then she smiled again and clutched Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s arm more tightly.

â€œListen to me, Prince,â€ said she. â€œI have never yet asked you
for anythinylovna,â€ said he with his usual familiarity and
weariness of tone, â€œit is almost impossible for me to do what you
ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your fatherâ€™s
memory, I will do the impossibleâ€”your son shall be transferred to the
Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?â€

â€œMy dear benefactor! This is what I expected from youâ€”I knew your
kindness!â€ He turned to go.

â€œWaitâ€”just a word! When he has been transferred to  asked Anna PÃ¡vlovna, â€œand of the comedy of the people of
Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and
Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of
the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make oneâ€™s head whirl! It is as
if the whole world had gone crazy.â€

Prince Andrew looked Anna PÃ¡vlovna straight in the face with a
sarcastic smile.

â€œâ€˜Dieu me la donne, gare Ã  qui la touche!â€™â€™ * They say he was
veich
he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts, â€œthings will have gone too
far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French societyâ€”I
mean good French societyâ€”will have been forever destroyed, and
then....â€

He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to
make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna PÃ¡vlovna,
who had him under observation, intehe was justified in saying so.â€

â€œNot in the least,â€ replied the vicomte. â€œAfter the murder of the
duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some
people,â€ he went on, turning to Anna PÃ¡vlovna, â€œhe ever was a hero,
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
hero less on earth.â€

Before Anna PÃ¡vlovna and the others had time to smile their
appreciation of the vicomteâ€™s epigram, Pierre again broke into ll that was good in itâ€”equality of citizenship and freedom
of speech and of the pressâ€”and only for that reason did he obtain
power.â€

â€œYes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to
commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have
called him a great man,â€ remarked the vicomte.

â€œHe could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might
rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great
man. Thwas
horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierreâ€™s sacrilegious words
had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was
impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
a vigorous attack on the orator.

â€œBut, my dear Monsieur Pierre,â€ said she, â€œhow do you explain the
fact of a great man executing a ducâ€”or even an ordinary man whoâ€”is
innocent and untried?â€

â€œI should like,â€ said the vicomte, â€œto ask howwardness of
Pierreâ€™s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go.

Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,
and asking them all to be seated began:

â€œI was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.
Excuse me, Vicomteâ€”I must tell it in Russian or the point will be
lost....â€ And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year here.





CHAPTER VI

Having thanked Anna PÃ¡vlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began
to take their leave.

Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge
red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing
room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something
particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was
absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the
generalvlovna, also in a low tone.
â€œWrite to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au
revoir! â€â€”and she left the hall.

Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face
close to her, began to whisper something.

Two footmen, the princessâ€™ and his own, stood holding a shawl and
a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to
the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
understanding but  saber; Prince Hippolyte, under
pretense of helping, was in everyoneâ€™s way.

â€œAllow me, sir,â€ said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,
disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.

â€œI am expecting you, Pierre,â€ said the same voice, but gently and
affectionately.

The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
whom he had promised to take home.ew was not interested in such abstract
conversation.

â€œOne canâ€™t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have
you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a
diplomatist?â€ asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.

Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.

â€œReally, I donâ€™t yet know. I donâ€™t like either the one or the
other.â€

â€œBut you must decide on something! Your father expects it.â€

Pierre wn conviction, there would be no
wars,â€ he said.

â€œAnd that would be splendid,â€ said Pierre.

Prince Andrew smiled ironically.

â€œVery likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....â€

â€œWell, why are you going to the war?â€ asked Pierre.

â€œWhat for? I donâ€™t know. I must. Besides that I am going....â€ He
paused. â€œI am going because the life I am leading here does not suit
me!â€





CHAPTER VII

The rustle of a womanâ€™s d a lady asking, â€˜Is that the famous Prince
Andrew?â€™ I did indeed.â€ She laughed. â€œHe is so well received
everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know
the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of
how to arrange it. What do you think?â€

Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
conversation, gave no reply.

â€œWhen are you starting?â€ he asked.

â€œOh, donâ€™t speak of his goin
The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.

â€œNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....â€

â€œYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,â€ said Prince Andrew.
â€œYou had better go.â€

The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.
Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.

Pierre looked over his spectacles with naÃ¯ve surprise, now at him and
now at her, moved as!â€ said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch
which indicates that patience is exhausted.

Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princessâ€™ pretty
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes
glanced askance at her husbandâ€™s face, and her own assumed the timid,
deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
drooping tail.

â€œMon Dieu, mon Dieu!â€ she muttered, and lifting her dress wihing from yourself in the future, you will feel at every
step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing
room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
idiot!... But whatâ€™s the good?...â€ and he waved his arm.

Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and
the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend
in amazement.

â€œMy wife,â€ continued Prince Andrew, â€œis an excellenhing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,â€ continued Prince
Andrew, â€œand at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s they listen to me. And that stupid
set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only
knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is
right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everythingâ€”thatâ€™s what
women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them
in society it seems as if there were something in them, Let us talk about you,â€ he added after a silence,
smiling at his reassuring thoughts.

That smile was immediately reflected on Pierreâ€™s face.

â€œBut what is there to say about me?â€ said Pierre, his face relaxing
into a careless, merry smile. â€œWhat am I? An illegitimate son!â€
He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great
effort to say this. â€œWithout a name and without means... And it
really...â€ But he did not say what â€œit realonâ€™t go.â€

â€œYou give me your word of honor not to go?â€

â€œOn my honor!â€





CHAPTER IX

It was past one oâ€™clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a
cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending
to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he
felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light
enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like
morning or evendistance.

Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.
Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the
remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on
the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of
laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and
general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
round an open window. Three other glass while
explaining that DÃ³lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval
officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.

â€œGo on, you must drink it all,â€ said Anatole, giving Pierre the last
glass, â€œor I wonâ€™t let you go!â€

â€œNo, I wonâ€™t,â€ said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up
to the window.

DÃ³lokhov was holding the Englishmanâ€™s hand and clearly and

Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to
smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
could not move it. He smashed a pane.

â€œYou have a try, Hercules,â€ said he, turning to Pierre.

Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with
a crash.

â€œTake it right out, or theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m holding on,â€ said
DÃ³lokhov.

â€œIs the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?â€ said, but gave no indication whether he intended to
accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though
he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating
DÃ³lokhovâ€™s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the
Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window
sill, leaned over, and looked down.

â€œOh! Oh! Oh!â€ he muttered, looking down from the window at the
stones of the pavement.

â€œShut up!â€threw back his head, and raised his free hand
to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
window and from DÃ³lokhovâ€™s back. Anatole stood erect with staring
eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man
who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw
himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from
whood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the
window sill.

â€œGentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? Iâ€™ll do the same thing!â€
he suddenly cried. â€œEven without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a
bottle. Iâ€™ll do it.... Bring a bottle!â€

â€œLet him do it, let him do it,â€ said DÃ³lokhov, smiling.

â€œWhat next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go
giddy even on a staircase,â€ exclaimed several voices.

â€œIâ€™ll drink it!d from
childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left
Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in
Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to RadzivÃ­lov.

It was St. Nataliaâ€™s day and the name day of two of the RostÃ³vsâ€”the
mother and the youngest daughterâ€”both named Nataly. Ever since
the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going
continually, bringing visitors to the Countess RostÃirm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As
soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were
still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily
spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air
of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and
fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on
questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very g room, their dresses rustling.

â€œDear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ...
at the RazumÃ³vskiâ€™s ball ... and Countess AprÃ¡ksina ... I was
so delighted...â€ came the sounds of animated feminine voices,
interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and
the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last
out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses
and say, â€œI am so delir hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.â€

â€œBut what have they been up to?â€ asked the countess.

â€œThey are regular brigands, especially DÃ³lokhov,â€ replied the
visitor. â€œHe is a son of MÃ¡rya IvÃ¡novna DÃ³lokhova, such a worthy
woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere,
put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The
police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied
a poHe has
lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.â€

â€œHow handsome the old man still was only a year ago!â€ remarked the
countess. â€œI have never seen a handsomer man.â€

â€œHe is very much altered now,â€ said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. â€œWell, as
I was saying, Prince VasÃ­li is the next heir through his wife, but the
count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to
the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his deathâ€”ander dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when
suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls
running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl
of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock,
darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident
that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in
the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officerainst
her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even
the prim visitor could not help joining in.

â€œNow then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,â€ said the
mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning
to the visitor she added: â€œShe is my youngest girl.â€

NatÃ¡sha, raising her face for a moment from her motherâ€™s mantilla,
glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.

The vie entered
the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but
failed. BorÃ­s on the contrary at once found his footing, and related
quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was
still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged
during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked
right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at NatÃ¡sha.
She turned away from him and glanced at her younger be general conversation by
smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes
watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate
girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose
upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to
spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as
they too could, like NatÃ¡sha and BorÃ­s, escape from the drawing room.

â€œAh yes, my dearish to let me go, Iâ€™ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere
except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.â€”I
donâ€™t know how to hide what I feel.â€ As he spoke he kept glancing
with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at SÃ³nya and the young
lady visitor.

The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment
to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.

â€œAll right, all right!â€ said the old count. â€œHeuestion no
one had put but which was always in her mind, â€œand how much suffering,
how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in
them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is
always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both
for girls and boys.â€

â€œIt all depends on the bringing up,â€ remarked the visitor.

â€œYes, youâ€™re quite right,â€ continued the countess. â€œTill now I
have always, the to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they
might be up to on the slyâ€ (she meant that they would be kissing),
â€œbut as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to
me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I
spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I
was stricter.â€

â€œYes, I was brought up quite differently,â€ remarked the handsome
elder daughter, Countess VÃ©ra, ly among the
flower tubs and hid there.

BorÃ­s paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little
dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined
his handsome face. NatÃ¡sha, very still, peered out from her ambush,
waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the
glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. NatÃ¡sha was about to
call him but changed her mind. â€œLet him look for me,â€ thought she.
Hardly hsaid she with a sly and significant look. â€œI
have something to tell you. Here, here!â€ and she led him into the
conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.

BorÃ­s followed her, smiling.

â€œWhat is the something?â€ asked he.

She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown
down on one of the tubs, picked it up.

â€œKiss the doll,â€ said she.

BorÃ­s looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not
rhis arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
sitting room.





CHAPTER XIV

After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave
orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to
dinner all who came â€œto congratulate.â€ The countess wished to have
a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna
MikhÃ¡ylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
Petersburg. Anna Msaid, dipping his pen.

â€œYou always manage to do things at the wrong time,â€ continued VÃ©ra.
â€œYou came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed
of you.â€

Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one
replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the
room with the inkstand in her hand.

â€œAnd at your age what secrets can there be between NatÃ¡sha and
BorÃ­s, or between you two? Itâ€™s all nw youâ€™ve done what you wanted,â€ put in Nicholasâ€”â€œsaid
unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Letâ€™s go to the
nursery.â€

All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.

â€œThe unpleasant things were said to me,â€ remarked VÃ©ra, â€œI said
none to anyone.â€

â€œMadame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!â€ shouted laughing voices
through the door.

The handsome VÃ©ra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant
effect on everyoned to whom did you apply about BÃ³ry?â€ asked the countess.
â€œYou see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas
is going as a cadet. Thereâ€™s no one to interest himself for him. To
whom did you apply?â€

â€œTo Prince VasÃ­li. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything,
and put the matter before the Emperor,â€ said Princess Anna
MikhÃ¡ylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she
had endured to gain her end.

â€œHas Priâ€ said the princess,
â€œthat here lives Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhov so rich, all
alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? Itâ€™s a
burden to him, and BÃ³ryâ€™s life is only just beginning....â€

â€œSurely he will leave something to BorÃ­s,â€ said the countess.

â€œHeaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.
Still, I will take BorÃ­s and go to see him at once, and I shall speak
to him straight out. Let people thier
all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice
to him, as you so well know how to be.â€

â€œIf only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of
it...â€ answered her son coldly. â€œBut I have promised and will do it
for your sake.â€

Although the hall porter saw someoneâ€™s carriage standing at the
entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to
be announced had passed straight through the glass porch omised me!â€

The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.

They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the
apartments assigned to Prince VasÃ­li.

Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were
about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince VasÃ­li
came outâ€”wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast,
as was his cdear Anna
MikhÃ¡ylovna,â€ said Prince VasÃ­li, arranging his lace frill, and in
tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna whom he had placed
under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he
had done in Petersburg at Anna SchÃ©rerâ€™s reception.

â€œTry to serve well and show yourself worthy,â€ added he, addressing
BorÃ­s with severity. â€œI am glad.... Are you here on leave?â€ he went
on in his usual tone of indifference.

â€œI aÃºkhovâ€™s fortune,
and hastened to reassure him.

â€œIf it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,â€
said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, â€œI
know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with
him except the young princesses.... They are still young....â€ She bent
her head and continued in a whisper: â€œHas he performed his final duty,
Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make thingsot even smile, but left the room as
Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she
had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince VasÃ­li to
take a seat beside her.

â€œBorÃ­s,â€ she said to her son with a smile, â€œI shall go in to see
the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile
and donâ€™t forget to give him the RostÃ³vsâ€™ invitation. They ask him
to dinner. I suppose he wonâ€™t go?â€ she continued,much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper.
The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him
with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression;
while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and
lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked
by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the
canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, s
When BorÃ­s appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,
stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,
as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely
over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering
indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.

â€œEngland is done for,â€ said he, scowling and pointing his finger
at someone unseen. â€œMr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation anrcastic smile. â€œI am BorÃ­s, son of Princess Anna
MikhÃ¡ylovna DrubetskÃ¡ya. RostÃ³v, the father, is IlyÃ¡, and his son is
Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.â€

Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.

â€œOh dear, what am I thinking about? Iâ€™ve mixed everything up. One
has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are BorÃ­s? Of course. Well, now
we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?
The English wiœSo it does,â€ thought Pierre.

â€œBut I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are
quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are
very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that
your father is rich, I donâ€™t regard myself as a relation of his, and
neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.â€

For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped
up from the sofa,een in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for
him as a man, but what can one do?â€

â€œAnd so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?â€ asked
BorÃ­s with a smile.

Pierre saw that BorÃ­s wished to change the subject, and being of the
same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
Boulogne expedition.

A footman came in to summon BorÃ­sâ€”the princess was going. Pierre, in
order to make BorÃ­sâ€™ better acqs so rich, and we are so poor!â€

â€œWell, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...â€

â€œOh, Heaven! How ill he is!â€ exclaimed the mother.





CHAPTER XVII

After Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril
VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhov, Countess RostÃ³va sat for a long time all
alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.

â€œWhat is the matter with you, my dear?â€ she said crossly to the maid
who kept her waitiill
rush to obey the summons. â€œSend DmÃ­tri to me!â€

DmÃ­tri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the countâ€™s
house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.

â€œThis is what I want, my dear fellow,â€ said the count to the
deferential young man who had entered. â€œBring me...â€ he reflected
a moment, â€œyes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, donâ€™t
bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clea countess
began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,
elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be
ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.

â€œThis is for BorÃ­s from me, for his outfit.â€

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess
wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were
kindheawhom he
egged on against each other.

One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable
young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,
having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the
smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,
ShinshÃ­n, a cousin of the countessâ€™, a man with â€œa sharp tongueâ€
ays related entirely to himself; he would remain calm
and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put
out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as
soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.

â€œConsider my position, Peter NikolÃ¡evich. Were I in the cavalry I
should get not more than teem to suspect that others,
too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily
sedate, and the naÃ¯vetÃ© of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that
he disarmed his hearers.

â€œWell, my boy, youâ€™ll get along wherever you goâ€”foot or
horseâ€”that Iâ€™ll warrant,â€ said ShinshÃ­n, patting him on the
shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.

Berg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the
drawing room.

It was just the
interesting.â€

â€œVery interesting.â€

The countess exchanged glances with Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. The latter
understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and
sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he
answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other
guests were all conversing with one another. â€œThe RazumÃ³vskis... It
was charming... You are very kind... Countess AprÃ¡ksina...â€ was heard
on all sisure
of her saintâ€™s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to
Pierre.

â€œEh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,â€ said she, assuming a soft high
tone of voice. â€œCome here, my friend...â€ and she ominously tucked
up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a
childlike way through his spectacles.

â€œCome nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell
your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case itâ€™h the hussar colonel on his left and ShinshÃ­n and the other male
visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the
grown-up young people: VÃ©ra beside Berg, and Pierre beside BorÃ­s; and
on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind
the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his
wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled
his neighborsâ€™ glasses, not neglecting his own. The cou look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for
the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny
lively little girlâ€™s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing
why.

Nicholas sat at some distance from SÃ³nya, beside Julie KarÃ¡gina, to
whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. SÃ³nya wore
a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned
pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger
vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell
as ze sanctity of its alliances...â€ he spoke this last word with
particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.

Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:

... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperorâ€™s sole and absolute
aimâ€”to establish peace in Eur.

â€œI am quite of your opinion,â€ replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning
his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision
and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great
danger. â€œI am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,â€ he
concluded, consciousâ€”as were othersâ€”after the words were uttered
that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and
were therefore awkward.

â€œWhat you said juslution. She half
rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what
was coming, and turning to her mother:

â€œMamma!â€ rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,
audible the whole length of the table.

â€œWhat is it?â€ asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her
daughterâ€™s face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her
sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.

The conversation was hushed.ices, champagne was served round. The band
again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving
their seats, went up to â€œcongratulateâ€ the countess, and reached
across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and
with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and
in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the
guests returned to the drawing room and to the countâ€™s study.





C bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink
dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing
so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. NatÃ¡shaâ€™s
face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saintâ€™s day, suddenly
changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad
neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.

â€œSÃ³nya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!â€ And
NatÃ¡shaâ€™s large would willingly sacrifice
everything, only I have nothing....â€

SÃ³nya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in
the feather bed. NatÃ¡sha began consoling her, but her face showed that
she understood all the gravity of her friendâ€™s trouble.

â€œSÃ³nya,â€ she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true
reason of her friendâ€™s sorrow, â€œIâ€™m sure VÃ©ra has said something
to you since dinner? Hasnâ€™t she?â€

â€œYes, these verses p down on its soft paws, and begin
playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.

â€œDo you think so?... Really? Truly?â€ she said, quickly smoothing her
frock and hair.

â€œReally, truly!â€ answered NatÃ¡sha, pushing in a crisp lock that had
strayed from under her friendâ€™s plaits.

Both laughed.

â€œWell, letâ€™s go and sing â€˜The Brook.â€™â€

â€œCome along!â€

â€œDo you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!â€ said
NatÃ¡sha, stme to ask you to join the dancers.â€

â€œI am afraid of mixing the figures,â€ Pierre replied; â€œbut if you
will be my teacher...â€ And lowering his big arm he offered it to the
slender little girl.

While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,
Pierre sat down with his little partner. NatÃ¡sha was perfectly happy;
she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was
sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a ge.)

â€œLook at Papa!â€ shouted NatÃ¡sha to the whole company, and quite
forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her
curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.

And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,
MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his
shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently wie dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could
not attract a momentâ€™s attention to their own evolutions and did not
even try to do so. All were watching the count and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.
NatÃ¡sha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to
â€œlook at Papa!â€ though as it was they never took their eyes off the
couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved
and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, ter the countâ€™s health, came himself
that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of
Catherineâ€™s court, Count BezÃºkhov.

The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up
respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an
hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their
bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the fade of the room. â€œHow young-looking he is!â€

â€œYes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes
anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.â€

â€œI knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.â€

The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a
graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a
table.

â€œBeautifulion.

Meanwhile Prince VasÃ­li had opened the door into the princessâ€™ room.

In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before
the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.
The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,
cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was
just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.

â€œAh, is it you, cousin?â€

She rose and smootht still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a
very serious talk.â€

Prince VasÃ­li said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,
now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant
expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes
too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the
next glanced round in alarm.

The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
hands, looked attentivehis noble soul peacefully to leave this...â€

â€œYes, yes, of course,â€ interrupted Prince VasÃ­li impatiently,
rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little
table that he had pushed away. â€œBut... in short, the fact is... you
know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left
all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.â€

â€œHe has made wills enough!â€ quietly remarked the princess. â€œBut he
cannot leaked, you
ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...â€

â€œWhat next?â€ the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not
changing the expression of her eyes. â€œI am a woman, and you think we
are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...
un bÃ¢tard!â€* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the
word would effectively prove to Prince VasÃ­li the invalidity of his
contention.

     * A bastard.

â€œWell her eyes did not change, and her voice
when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
evidently did not expect.

â€œThat would be a fine thing!â€ said she. â€œI never wanted anything
and I donâ€™t now.â€

She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.

â€œAnd this is gratitudeâ€”this is recognition for those who have
sacrificed everything for his sake!â€ she cried. â€œItâ€™s splendid!
Fine! I donâ€™t want anything, Prince.,
that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one
has to be cunning and cruel.â€

â€œNow come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.â€

â€œNo, I have a wicked heart.â€

â€œI know your heart,â€ repeated the prince. â€œI value your friendship
and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Donâ€™t upset yourself,
and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it
but an hour.... Tell me all you know about  mind. The time
will come!â€





CHAPTER XXII

While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the
princessâ€™ room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for)
and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was
driving into the court of Count BezÃºkhovâ€™s house. As the wheels
rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,
having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that
he  to the princessesâ€™ apartments?â€ asked Anna
MikhÃ¡ylovna of one of them.

â€œYes,â€ replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were
now permissible; â€œthe door to the left, maâ€™am.â€

â€œPerhaps the count did not ask for me,â€ said Pierre when he reached
the landing. â€œIâ€™d better go to my own room.â€

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna paused and waited for him to come up.

â€œAh, my friend!â€ she said, touching his arm as she had done her
sonâ€™s when sp VasÃ­li drew back with obvious
impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of
desperation slammed the door with all her might.

This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on
Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre
stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna
MikhÃ¡ylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as
if to say that this was no more than she ught with her the person the
dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid
glance at all those in the room and noticing the countâ€™s confessor
there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet
seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing
first of one and then of another priest.

â€œGod be thanked that you are in time,â€ said she to one of the
priests; â€œall we relatives have been in such amoved to make way for him. At first Pierre
wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to
pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not
even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and
that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful
rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound
to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the
aide-de-camp, and sat in passing and went
through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his
whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and
the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.
Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and
at last Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, still with the same expression, pale but
resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly
on the arm said:

â€œThe divine mertering vestments,
with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the
service. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding
handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest
sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on
the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for
herself should she glance round. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, with a meek,
sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression onwithout laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of
temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst
of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered
to one another, and the old servant who was holding the countâ€™s hand
got up and said something to the ladies. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna stepped
forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from
behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he wf the priest was
heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around
him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which
Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s was the most distinct.

Pierre heard her say:

â€œCertainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be
impossible...â€

The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants
that Pierre could nrried the sick man dispersed. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna touched Pierreâ€™s
hand and said, â€œCome.â€ Pierre went with her to the bed on which the
sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony
just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His
hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms
downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but
with a look the significance of which could not be undertch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one
side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and
from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna
MikhÃ¡ylovna looked attentively at the sick manâ€™s eyes, trying to
guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink,
then named Prince VasÃ­li in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the
quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. Hde
something as she whispered:

â€œI canâ€™t bear the sight of that woman.â€

â€œCatiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,â€ said Prince
VasÃ­li to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. â€œGo and take something, my poor Anna
MikhÃ¡ylovna, or you will not hold out.â€

To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna into the small
drawing room.

â€œThere is nothing so refreshing after a sleeptial, and after a short interval followed her. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna
was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited
whispers.

â€œPermit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not
necessary,â€ said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the
same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.

â€œBut, my dear princess,â€ answered Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna blandly but
impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom aon tenaciously, her voice lost none
of its honeyed firmness and softness.

â€œPierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a
family consultation; is it not so, Prince?â€

â€œWhy donâ€™t you speak, cousin?â€ suddenly shrieked the princess so
loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. â€œWhy
do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to
interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying manâ€™s room? are you doing!â€ she cried vehemently. â€œHe is dying and you
leave me alone with him!â€

Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, stooping, quickly
caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest
princess and Prince VasÃ­li, recovering themselves, followed her. A few
minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again
biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an
irrepressible hatred.

â€œYf you.
But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command
of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you
well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes
duties on you, and you must be a man.â€

Pierre was silent.

â€œPerhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been
there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised
me only the day before yesterday not to for routine of life in the old
princeâ€™s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas AndrÃ©evich
(nicknamed in society, â€œthe King of Prussiaâ€) ever since the Emperor
Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle
Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the
capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that
anyone who wanted to see him could , till the prince
appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this
antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when
the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather
small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray
eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd,
youthfully glittering eyes.

On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princes gave his children a blessing,
so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding
her tenderly and attentively, said severely:

â€œQuite well? All right then, sit down.â€ He took the exercise book
containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
with his foot.

â€œFor tomorrow!â€ said he, quickly finding the page and making a
scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.

The princess bent over the exercise bed patches on her face came and went, and it was
plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her
fear would prevent her understanding any of her fatherâ€™s further
explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the
teacherâ€™s fault or the pupilâ€™s, this same thing happened every day:
the princessâ€™ eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear
anything, but was only conscious of her stern fatherâ€™s withered face
close to her, of hi
Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that
rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She
sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and
which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as
her father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke
the seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from
childhood; that same Julie KarÃ¡gina who had been never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyesâ€”the look
they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her
face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a
glass. She went on reading:

All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already
abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march
to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought
intends to expose his preciouMoscow gossips, is the death of
old Count BezÃºkhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses
have received very little, Prince VasÃ­li nothing, and it is Monsieur
Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count BezÃºkhov and
possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince
VasÃ­li played a very despicable part in this affair and that he
returned to Petersburg quite crestfallenent for me to go and dine at the AprÃ¡ksinsâ€™. Read the
mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though
there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it
is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give
my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle
Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.

JULIE

P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.

The princessat he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!

I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always
seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value
most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince
VasÃ­li, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine
Saviourâ€™s words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a neeoam, the better we shall please God, who
rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek
to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will
He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.

My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he
has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince VasÃ­li. In
regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet
friend, thae another.

Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy
Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!

MARY

â€œAh, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched
mine. I have written to my poor mother,â€ said the smiling Mademoiselle
Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural râ€™s.
She brought into Princess Maryâ€™s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy
world a quite different atmosphere, carelkhon knew that neither the sonâ€™s arrival nor any other unusual
event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince
Andrew apparently knew this as well as TÃ­khon; he looked at his watch
as if to ascertain whether his fatherâ€™s habits had changed since he
was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he
turned to his wife.

â€œHe will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Maryâ€™s
room,â€ he said.

The little princese
middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Maryâ€™s heavy tread and the
sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who
had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in
each otherâ€™s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they
happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her
hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to
cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders aawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had
had on the SpÃ¡sski Hill which might have been serious for her in her
condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left
all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty
OdÃ½ntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitorll his love and respect for his father, he was
aware of his weaknesses.

â€œThe hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and
my geometry lessons,â€ said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons
in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.

When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
prince to get up, TÃ­khon came to call the young prince to his father.
The old man made a departure from his usual routine in is
fatherâ€™s face with an eager and respectful look. â€œHow is your
health?â€

â€œOnly fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from
morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.â€

â€œThank God,â€ said his son smiling.

â€œGod has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,â€ he continued,
returning to his hobby; â€œtell me how the Germans have taught you to
fight Bonaparte by this new science you call â€˜strategy.â€™â€

Prince Andrew  how two hundred and twenty
thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in
Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English
were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand
men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did
not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were
not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three
times unexpectedsocial distinctions and rarely admitted even important
government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael
IvÃ¡novich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his
checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals,
and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael IvÃ¡novich
was â€œnot a whit worse than you or I.â€ At dinner the prince usually
spoke to the taciturn Michael IvÃ¡novich more often than to anyone e expected footsteps were heard
coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock
struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing
room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under
their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on
the little princess. turned away and addressed Michael IvÃ¡novich.

â€œWell, Michael IvÃ¡novich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time
of it. Prince Andrewâ€ (he always spoke thus of his son) â€œhas been
telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I
never thought much of him.â€

Michael IvÃ¡novich did not at all know when â€œyou and Iâ€ had said
such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as
a peg on which to hang the princeâ€™s favori himself! When you get there youâ€™ll find out what
those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! SuvÃ³rov couldnâ€™t manage them so
what chance has Michael KutÃºzov? No, my dear boy,â€ he continued,
â€œyou and your generals wonâ€™t get on against Buonaparte; youâ€™ll
have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight
together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to
fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,â€ he said, alluding to the invitation made
that  change his opinion. He
listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this
old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and
discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and
political events.

â€œYou think Iâ€™m an old man and donâ€™t understand the present state
of affairs?â€ concluded his father. â€œBut it troubles me. I donâ€™t
sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown
his from
his father who had brought it from the siege of OchÃ¡kov. All these
traveling effects of Prince Andrewâ€™s were in very good order: new,
clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.

When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable
of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments
one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrewâ€™s face
looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him hncess noticed the ironical and
contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.

â€œOne must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,
Andrew? Donâ€™t forget that she has grown up and been educated in
society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into
everyoneâ€™s situation. Tout comprendre, câ€™est tout pardonner. * Think
what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,
to be parted from her husband and be llikes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads
splendidly.â€

â€œTo be quite frank, Mary, I expect Fatherâ€™s character sometimes
makes things trying for you, doesnâ€™t it?â€ Prince Andrew asked
suddenly.

Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.

â€œFor me? For me?... Trying for me!...â€ said she.

â€œHe always was rather harsh; and now I should think heâ€™s getting
very trying,â€ said Prince Andrew, apparentlyt it will comfort me. Promise,
AndrÃºsha!...â€ said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were
the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was
granted.

She looked timidly at her brother.

â€œEven if it were a great deal of trouble...â€ answered Prince Andrew,
as if guessing what it was about.

â€œThink what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as
youe kissed him on the forehead and sat down
again on the sofa. They were silent for a while.

â€œAs I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always
used to be. Donâ€™t judge Lise harshly,â€ she began. â€œShe is so
sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.â€

â€œI do not think I have complained of my wife to you, MÃ¡sha, or blamed
her. Why do you say all this to me?â€

Red patches appeared on Princess Maryâ€™s face and she was d moved to the door, then stopped and said:
â€œAndrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him
to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been
answered.â€

â€œWell, maybe!â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œGo, MÃ¡sha; Iâ€™ll come
immediately.â€

On the way to his sisterâ€™s room, in the passage which connected one
wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling
sweetly. It was the third time that day that, wio dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.
Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense
house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The
domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to
the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the
reception hall: Michael IvÃ¡novich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess
Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his he
was writing. â€œIâ€™ll do it.â€

He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
laugh.

â€œItâ€™s a bad business, eh?â€

â€œWhat is bad, Father?â€

â€œThe wife!â€ said the old prince, briefly and significantly.

â€œI donâ€™t understand!â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œNo, it canâ€™t be helped, lad,â€ said the prince. â€œTheyâ€™re
all like that; one canâ€™t unmarry. Donâ€™t be afraid; I wonâ€™t tell
anyone, but you know it yourself.â€
hall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;
hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond
and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of
SuvÃ³rovâ€™s wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for
you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.â€

Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time
yet. He felt that he must not say it.

â€œI will do it all, Father,â€ hsaid the little princess, turning pale and
looking with dismay at her husband.

He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.

He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,
and carefully placed her in an easy chair.

â€œAdieu, Mary,â€ said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand
and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.

The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafince of any Russian regiment preparing for
an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.

On the evening of the last dayâ€™s march an order had been received that
the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though
the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and
the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
to present the regiment inform
showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He
had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of
his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled
himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander
admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was
engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to in the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander
in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these
circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the
men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the
commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the
regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and
spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.

â€œA fine mm a distance.

â€œWhatever is this? This!â€ he shouted and stood still. â€œCommander
of the third company!â€

â€œCommander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to
the general... third company to the commander.â€ The words passed along
the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.

When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in
a cry of: â€œThe general to the third company,â€ the missing officer
appeareeduced
to the ranks,â€ said the captain softly.

â€œWell? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?
If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the
others.â€

â€œYour excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.â€

â€œGave him leave? Leave? Thatâ€™s just like you young men,â€ said the
regimental commander cooling down a little. â€œLeave indeed.... One says
a word to you and you... What?â€ he added with renewed iris horse, seized the stirrup
with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,
drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening
his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird
preening its plumage and became motionless.

â€œAtt-ention!â€ shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking
voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and
welcome for the approaching chief.

Along the b
it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
greater zeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and
assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that
had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There
were only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except
the boots.

KutÃºzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few
friendly words to officers he had knotch their chief. On reaching the
third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this,
involuntarily came closer to him.

â€œAh, TimÃ³khin!â€ said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had
been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.

One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself
more than TimÃ³khin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew
 me to remind you of the officer DÃ³lokhov, reduced to the
ranks in this regiment.â€

â€œWhere is DÃ³lokhov?â€ asked KutÃºzov.

DÃ³lokhov, who had already changed into a soldierâ€™s gray greatcoat,
did not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired
soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went
up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.

â€œHave you a complaint to make?â€ KutÃºzov asked with a slight frown.

â€œThistal commanderâ€™s face now that the inspection was happily
over beamed with irrepressible delight.) â€œItâ€™s in the Emperorâ€™s
service... it canâ€™t be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on
parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very
pleased!â€ And he held out his hand to the captain.

â€œDonâ€™t mention it, General, as if Iâ€™d be so bold!â€ replied the
captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where
two front teeraised!â€ and he rode past that
company and overtook the next one.

â€œWell, heâ€™s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,â€ said
TimÃ³khin to the subaltern beside him.

â€œIn a word, a hearty one...â€ said the subaltern, laughing (the
regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).

The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiersâ€™ voices could be
heard on every side.

â€œd, the people are quite beggarly. There they all
seemed to be Polesâ€”all under the Russian crownâ€”but here theyâ€™re
all regular Germans.â€

â€œSingers to the frontâ€ came the captainâ€™s order.

And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A
drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing
his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiersâ€™ song, commencing with the
words: â€œMorning dawned, the sun was rising,â€ and concluding:he dancing
soldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file
from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company,
a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was DÃ³lokhov
marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and
looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that
moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of KutÃºzovâ€™s
suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fellœWhy, have you too much money?â€

â€œDo come.â€

â€œI canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve sworn not to. I wonâ€™t drink and wonâ€™t play till
I get reinstated.â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s only till the first engagement.â€

â€œWe shall see.â€

They were again silent.

â€œCome if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the
staff...â€

DÃ³lokhov smiled. â€œDonâ€™t trouble. If I want anything, I wonâ€™t
begâ€”Iâ€™ll take it!â€

â€œWell, never mind; I only...â€

â€œAnd 
ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me
personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command
of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful
generalâ€”of whom Austria has so manyâ€”and to lay down all this heavy
responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us,
General.â€

And KutÃºzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, â€œYou are quite at
liberty not to believe me and I donâ€™t even careory and stated strategically the position of the
army was very favorable.

â€œGive me that letter,â€ said KutÃºzov turning to Prince Andrew.
â€œPlease have a look at itâ€â€”and KutÃºzov with an ironical smile
about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the
following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinandâ€™s letter:

We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross thAndrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the
first not only what had been said but also what KutÃºzov would have
liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,
stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.

Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he
had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face,
in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his is hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,
KozlÃ³vski, who was sitting at the window with a book.

â€œWell, Prince?â€ asked KozlÃ³vski.

â€œI am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
advancing.â€

â€œAnd why is it?â€

Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.

â€œAny news from Mack?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œIf it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.â€

â€œProbably,â€ said Prince Andrew moving toward head bent forward
as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides
with his thin legs, went up to KutÃºzov.

â€œVous voyez le malheureux Mack,â€ he uttered in a broken voice.

KutÃºzovâ€™s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave
and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully,
closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before oticing Prince Andrewâ€™s
pale face and glittering eyes.

â€œThereâ€™s nothing to be gay about,â€ answered BolkÃ³nski.

Just as Prince Andrew met NesvÃ­tski and ZherkÃ³v, there came toward
them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general
who on KutÃºzovâ€™s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian
army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous
evening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals by the appearance
of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the
Russian army found vent in anger at ZherkÃ³vâ€™s untimely jest.

â€œIf you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,â€ he said
sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, â€œI canâ€™t prevent
your doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my
presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.â€

NesvÃ­tski and ZherkÃ³v were so surprised by this outburstfor you, not for
     you.â€


He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned
and went out of the corridor.





CHAPTER IV

The PÃ¡vlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The
squadron in which Nicholas RostÃ³v served as a cadet was quartered in
the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were
assigned to cavalry-captain DenÃ­sov, the squadron commander, known
throughout the whole cavalry divisiowill be!â€ he thought with a smile, and
holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the
porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in
hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face
immediately brightened on seeing RostÃ³v. â€œSchÃ¶n gut Morgen! SchÃ¶n
gut Morgen!â€ * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased
to greet the young man.

    * â€œA very good morning! A very good morning!â€
â€œYes, bring some.â€

Ten minutes later LavrÃºshka brought the coffee. â€œHeâ€™s coming!â€
said he. â€œNow for trouble!â€ RostÃ³v looked out of the window and
saw DenÃ­sov coming home. DenÃ­sov was a small man with a red face,
sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an
unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled
shako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging
his head.

â€œLavwÃºske; but thereâ€™s nothing foh one
to do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, whoâ€™s
there?â€ he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy
boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful
cough.

â€œThe squadron quartermaster!â€ said LavrÃºshka.

DenÃ­sovâ€™s face puckered still more.

â€œWetched!â€ he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it.
â€œWostÃ³v, deah fellow, just see how much there is lef you what to do
and show you what kind of rivet to use.â€

â€œYes, please do,â€ said RostÃ³v.

â€œIâ€™ll show you, Iâ€™ll show you! Itâ€™s not a secret. And itâ€™s a
horse youâ€™ll thank me for.â€

â€œThen Iâ€™ll have it brought round,â€ said RostÃ³v wishing to avoid
TelyÃ¡nin, and he went out to give the order.

In the passage DenÃ­sov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold
facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing RostÃ³v,
DenÃ­sov ker in words what he wanted to
write, told RostÃ³v the contents of his letter.

â€œYou see, my fwiend,â€ he said, â€œwe sleep when we donâ€™t love. We
are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one
is puaâ€™ as on the fihst day of cweation... Whoâ€™s that now? Send him
to the devil, Iâ€™m busy!â€ he shouted to LavrÃºshka, who went up to
him not in the least abashed.

â€œWho should it be? You yourself told him to come. Itâ€™s the
quartermasœBut it isnâ€™t?...â€

â€œYouâ€™re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget
it. Feel in your pockets.â€

â€œNo, if I hadnâ€™t thought of it being a treasure,â€ said RostÃ³v,
â€œbut I remember putting it there.â€

LavrÃºshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under
the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the
room. DenÃ­sov silently watched LavrÃºshkaâ€™s movements, and when the
latter threw up his a know who has taken it,â€ repeated RostÃ³v in an unsteady voice,
and went to the door.

â€œAnd I tell you, donâ€™t you dahe to do it!â€ shouted DenÃ­sov,
rushing at the cadet to restrain him.

But RostÃ³v pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though
DenÃ­sov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his
face.

â€œDo you understand what youâ€™re saying?â€ he said in a trembling
voice. â€œThere was no one else in the room except myself. So t
the waiter.

â€œPlease be quick,â€ he said.

The coin was a new one. RostÃ³v rose and went up to TelyÃ¡nin.

â€œAllow me to look at your purse,â€ he said in a low, almost
inaudible, voice.

With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, TelyÃ¡nin handed him the
purse.

â€œYes, itâ€™s a nice purse. Yes, yes,â€ he said, growing suddenly
pale, and added, â€œLook at it, young man.â€

RostÃ³v took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and
look enormous load of doubt
fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the
miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be
completed.

â€œHeaven only knows what the people here may imagine,â€ muttered
TelyÃ¡nin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. â€œWe
must have an explanation...â€

â€œI know it and shall prove it,â€ said RostÃ³v.

â€œI...â€

Every muscle of TelyÃ¡ninâ€™s pale, terrified face beg
me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it
beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...â€

â€œYou just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,â€ interrupted
the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache.
â€œYou tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an
officer has stolen...â€

â€œIâ€™m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of
other officers. Perhaps I ought not to haisgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one
scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We donâ€™t see it like that. And
BogdÃ¡nich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true.
Itâ€™s not pleasant, but whatâ€™s to be done, my dear fellow? You landed
yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some
conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole
affair public. You are offended at being put on duk... I quite understand.
Youâ€™re wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of
the regiment Iâ€™d... Ah well, Iâ€™ll show that in action, and for me
the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, itâ€™s true Iâ€™m to blame,
to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...â€

â€œCome, thatâ€™s right, Count!â€ cried the staff captain, turning
round and clapping RostÃ³v on the shoulder with his big hand.

â€œI tell you,â€ shouted DenÃ­sov, â€œheâ€™s a 

â€œInto action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how
did you come here?â€

â€œIâ€™ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil,
Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on
Mackâ€™s arrival... Whatâ€™s the matter, RostÃ³v? You look as if youâ€™d
just come out of a hot bath.â€

â€œOh, my dear fellow, weâ€™re in such a stew here these last two
days.â€

The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the ner side of the Enns the
enemyâ€™s horse patrols could be discerned.

Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through
his fieldglass. A little behind them NesvÃ­tski, who had been sent to
the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a
gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack
and a flask, and NesvÃ­tski was treating some offics,
laughing.

Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to
the general, who looked through his field glass.

â€œYes, so it is, so it is,â€ said the general angrily, lowering the
field glass and shrugging his shoulders, â€œso it is! Theyâ€™ll be fired
on at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?â€

On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from
their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant de flew above the heads of our
troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke
showing the spot where it burst.

The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got
up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly
visible as if but a stoneâ€™s throw away, and the movements of the
approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully
out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitaof soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos,
knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with
broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and
feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of
white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with
a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along;
sometimeHow they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think theyâ€™ll
all be killed,â€ a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.

â€œAs it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,â€ said a young soldier
with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, â€œI felt like
dying of fright. I did, â€˜pon my word, I got that frightened!â€ said
he, as if bragging of having been frightened.

That one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone
before. Ithey had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same
kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of
a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole
crowd had to wait.

â€œAnd why are they stopping? Thereâ€™s no proper order!â€ said the
soldiers. â€œWhere are you shoving to? Devil take you! Canâ€™t you wait?
Itâ€™ll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, hereâ€™s an officer jammed
in tooâ€â€”different voiceg and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small
bare hand as red as his face.

â€œAh, VÃ¡ska!â€ joyfully replied NesvÃ­tski. â€œWhatâ€™s up with
you?â€

â€œThe squadwon canâ€™t pass,â€ shouted VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, showing his
white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which
twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting
white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his
hoofs, and apparently ready to j way DenÃ­sov stopped at the end of the bridge.
Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw
nearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,
resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in
front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge
on his side of it.

The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in thwas not yet visible from
the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away.
At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our
Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high
ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the
French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All
the officers and men of Denks, or at any rate
feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives
a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that
takes place at such moments.

On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose,
and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The
officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The
hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole
rtseying there? Cadet MiwÃ³nov! Thatâ€™s not wight!
Look at me,â€ cried DenÃ­sov who, unable to keep still on one spot,
kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.

The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov, and his whole
short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in
which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually
did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he
was only redder than uacross and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side
of the river.

The two PÃ¡vlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the
hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl BogdÃ¡nich Schubert, came
up to DenÃ­sovâ€™s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from RostÃ³v,
without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
first time since their encounter concerning TelyÃ¡nin. RostÃ³v, feeling
that he was at the front and in the power colonel morosely.

â€œI donâ€™t myself know â€˜to who,â€™â€ replied the cornet in a
serious tone, â€œbut the prince told me to â€˜go and tell the colonel
that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.â€™â€

ZherkÃ³v was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout NesvÃ­tski
came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
weight.

â€œHowâ€™s this, Colonel?â€ he shl the bridge fire,â€ he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
do the right thing.

Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame
for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
squadron, that in which RostÃ³v was serving under DenÃ­sov, to return to
the bridge.

â€œThere, itâ€™s just as I thought,â€ said RostÃ³v to himself. â€œHe
wishes to test me!â€ands. The others outstripped him.

â€œAt boss zides, Captain,â€ he heard the voice of the colonel, who,
having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a
triumphant, cheerful face.

RostÃ³v wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front
the better. But BogdÃ¡nich, without looking at or recognizing RostÃ³v,
shouted to him:

â€œWhoâ€™s that running on the middle of smart fellows could have
done the job just as well.â€

â€œAh, your excellency,â€ put in ZherkÃ³v, his eyes fixed on the
hussars, but still with that naÃ¯ve air that made it impossible to know
whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. â€œAh, your excellency!
How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the
VladÃ­mir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the
squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Ouroup of hussars and
knocked three of them over.

RostÃ³v, absorbed by his relations with BogdÃ¡nich, had paused on the
bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he
had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the
bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the
other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a
rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest
tors, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one
feeling of sickening agitation.

â€œO Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect
me!â€ RostÃ³v whispered.

The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices
sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.

â€œWell, fwiend? So youâ€™ve smelt powdah!â€ shouted VÃ¡ska DenÃ­sov
just above his ear.

â€œItâ€™s all over; but I am a cowardâ€”yes, a coward!dence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies,
and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had
been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded
by KutÃºzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where
overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as
necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment.
There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despitunded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and
wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter
in which KutÃºzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and
though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military
hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the
stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of
the army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headqgun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon
as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the
wheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that
the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he
quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that
this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away. He
again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage
during 
streets of BrÃ¼nn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the
lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that
atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a
soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night,
Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
alert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly
and his thoughts followed one another withim a right to despise
the adjutant and the minister. â€œAway from the smell of powder, they
probably think it easy to gain victories!â€ he thought. His eyes
narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with
peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened
when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers
and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes
taking no notice of his arrival. A
calamity! What a calamity!â€

Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.

â€œAh what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is
not captured.â€ Again he pondered. â€œI am very glad you have brought
good news, though Schmidtâ€™s death is a heavy price to pay for the
victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I
thank you! You must have a rest. Be aroundings such
as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant,
after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian
(for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he
supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was
then particularly strong.

BilÃ­bin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as
Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but
had becng and took part in a conversation only when that was
possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,
finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the
inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so
that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to
drawing room. And, in fact, BilÃ­binâ€™s witticisms were hawked about
in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on math all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier
and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers!
Whereâ€™s the victory?â€

â€œBut seriously,â€ said Prince Andrew, â€œwe can at any rate say
without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...â€

â€œWhy didnâ€™t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?â€

â€œBecause not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness
of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get atat last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the
invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care
to hear the details.â€

â€œThatâ€™s just it, my dear fellow. You see itâ€™s hurrah for the Tsar,
for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but
what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring
us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one
archdukeâ€™s as good as another, as you tory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you canâ€™t be
received as a savior.â€

â€œReally I donâ€™t care about that, I donâ€™t care at all,â€ said
Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle
before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as
the fall of Austriaâ€™s capital. â€œHow is it Vienna was taken? What of
the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard
reports that Prince Auersperg wanaparte?â€ said BilÃ­bin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead
to indicate that he was about to say something witty. â€œBuonaparte?â€
he repeated, accentuating the u: â€œI think, however, now that he lays
down laws for Austria at SchÃ¶nbrunn, il faut lui faire grÃ¢ce de
lâ€™u! * I shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply
Bonaparte!â€

    * â€œWe must let him off the u!â€


â€œBut joking apart,â€ said Prince Andrew, â€œdo you really think the
cfiring, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode
forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around,
and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since
childhood.

He woke up...

â€œYes, that all happened!â€ he said, and, smiling happily to himself
like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.





CHAPTER XI

Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first
thought that came into his mind wa was so to regard it.
Can you fancy the figure he cut?...â€

â€œBut the worst of it, gentlemenâ€”I am giving KurÃ¡gin away to
youâ€”is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is
taking advantage of it!â€

Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its
arm. He began to laugh.

â€œTell me about that!â€ he said.

â€œOh, you Don Juan! You serpent!â€ cried several voices.

â€œYou, BolkÃ³nski, donâ€™t know,â€ said BilÃ­bin mber 18. That is how it will end.â€
And he released BolkÃ³nskiâ€™s arm to indicate that he had now quite
finished.

â€œDemosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden
mouth!â€ said BilÃ­bin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with
satisfaction.

Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently
distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild
laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.

â€ and canâ€™t do it, as
you will see.â€





CHAPTER XII

At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had
been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his
face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was
over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed
BolkÃ³nski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor
Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. BeœAt seven oâ€™clock, I believe.â€

â€œAt seven oâ€™clock? Itâ€™s very sad, very sad!â€

The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and
was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he
saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterdayâ€™s adjutant
reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him
his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the
Maria Theresa Order of the third to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.

â€œThere now! Confess that this is delightful,â€ said he. â€œThis
affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without
striking a blow!â€

Prince Andrew could not understand.

â€œBut where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the
town knows?â€

â€œI come from the archduchessâ€™. I heard nothing there.â€

â€œAnd you didnâ€™t see that everybody is packing up?â€

â€œI did no* The marshalls.

â€œStop jesting,â€ said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news
grieved him and yet he was pleased.

As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless
situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it
out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from
the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!
Listening to BilÃ­bin he was already imagining how on reaching the and so dazzled by the
sight of Muratâ€™s mantle and ostrich plumes, quâ€™il nâ€™y voit que du
feu, et oublie celui quâ€™il devait faire faire sur lâ€™ennemi!â€ *(2)
In spite of the animation of his speech, BilÃ­bin did not forget to
pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. â€œThe
French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the
bridge is taken! But what is best of all,â€ he went on, his excitement
subsiding under the delightful ie right
expression. â€œCâ€™est... câ€™est du Mack. Nous sommes mackÃ©s (It is...
it is a bit of Mack. We are Macked),â€ he concluded, feeling that he
had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His
hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a
slight smile he began to examine his nails.

â€œWhere are you off to?â€ he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had
risen and was going toward his room.

â€œI am going away.â€

€œeither you
will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will
share defeat and disgrace with KutÃºzovâ€™s whole army.â€

And BilÃ­bin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was
insoluble.

â€œI cannot argue about it,â€ replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he
thought: â€œI am going to save the army.â€

â€œMy dear fellow, you are a hero!â€ said BilÃ­bin.





CHAPTER XIII

That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War,the ends of
     the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same
     fateâ€”(the fate of the army at Ulm).â€


He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments,
carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all
kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and
sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear
could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up
and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention
was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An
officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving
the womanâ€™s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes
of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed
piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apthe worldâ€”to ridicule; but
his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence
Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised
his riding whip.

â€œKind...ly letâ€”themâ€”pass!â€

The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.

â€œItâ€™s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that thereâ€™s
this disorder,â€ he muttered. â€œDo as you like.â€

Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
dere.â€

â€œAnd we, my dear boy! Itâ€™s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,
weâ€™re getting it still worse,â€ said NesvÃ­tski. â€œBut sit down and
have something to eat.â€

â€œYou wonâ€™t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,
Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,â€ said the other
adjutant.

â€œWhere are headquarters?â€

â€œWe are to spend the night in Znaim.â€

â€œWell, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,â€â€œThe Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...â€

â€œOne canâ€™t write so fast, your honor,â€ said the clerk, glancing
angrily and disrespectfully at KozlÃ³vski.

Through the door came the sounds of KutÃºzovâ€™s voice, excited and
dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the
sound of these voices, the inattentive way KozlÃ³vski looked at him, the
disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and
KozlÃ³vski were squatting on the fl. â€œMy blessing, and
may Christ be with you in your great endeavor!â€

His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left
hand he drew BagratiÃ³n toward him, and with his right, on which he wore
a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently
habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but BagratiÃ³n kissed him on the
neck instead.

â€œChrist be with you!â€ KutÃºzov repeated and went toward his
carriage. â€œGet in with me,â€ some ladies they both knew.





CHAPTER XIV

On November 1 KutÃºzov had received, through a spy, news that the army
he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that
the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in
immense force upon KutÃºzovâ€™s line of communication with the troops
that were arriving from Russia. If KutÃºzov decided to remain at Krems,
Napoleonâ€™s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him
ed the news, KutÃºzov sent BagratiÃ³nâ€™s vanguard,
four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim
to the Vienna-Znaim road. BagratiÃ³n was to make this march without
resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he
succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as
possible. KutÃºzov himself with all his transport took the road to
Znaim.

Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, witoffer the Russian army the three daysâ€™ truce.
BagratiÃ³n replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse
a truce and sent his adjutant to KutÃºzov to report the offer he had
received.

A truce was KutÃºzovâ€™s sole chance of gaining time, giving
BagratiÃ³nâ€™s exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and
heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance
if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only,Inform him that the
general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no
one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.

If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will
ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian
army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.

The Russian Emperorâ€™s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are
nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrthe order of retreat, â€œwhich is also
very important.â€

â€œHowever, there will hardly be an engagement today,â€ said BagratiÃ³n
as if to reassure Prince Andrew.

â€œIf he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a
medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he
wishes to stay with me, let him... heâ€™ll be of use here if heâ€™s a
brave officer,â€ thought BagratiÃ³n. Prince Andrew, without replying,
asked the princeâ€™s permie prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you,
Captain,â€ and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who
without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry),
in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether
comfortably.

â€œWell, arenâ€™t you ashamed of yourself, Captain TÃºshin?â€ he
continued. â€œOne would think that as an artillery officer you would set
a good example, yet here you are without youof white ants;
spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the
bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at
the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some
dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the
entrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a
trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.

â€œVoilÃ  lâ€™agrÃ©ment des camps, monsiery chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others,
dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending
boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers.
In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly
at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster
sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log
before his shelter, had been tasted.

Another company, a lucky one e desperate but unnatural
screams, continued.

â€œGo on, go on!â€ said the major.

A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
as he rode by.

Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front
line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks,
but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that
morning, the lineble to
him. â€œMore, please: more! Whatâ€™s he saying?â€

DÃ³lokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot
dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the
campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was
trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all
the way from Ulm, while DÃ³lokhov maintained that the Russians had not
surrendered but had beaten the French.

â€œWe have orders to  only thing left to do seemed to be
to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as
quickly as possible.

But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and
entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon
confronted one another as before.





CHAPTER XVI

Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince
Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
told him tharating us from SchÃ¶n
Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked
the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was
wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us
on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it
difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took
out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the
position. He made some notes on thatâ€™s so,
friend.â€

Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: â€œAfraid or not, you canâ€™t
escape it anyhow.â€

â€œAll the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,â€ said a third
manly voice interrupting them both. â€œOf course you artillery men are
very wise, because you can take everything along with youâ€”vodka and
snacks.â€

And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,
laughed.

â€œYes, one is afraid,â€ continued the first spherto
motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was
a battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two
mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A
small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,
probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had
not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report.
The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his hodrew stopped, waiting for
him to come up; Prince BagratiÃ³n reined in his horse and recognizing
Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew
told him what he had seen.

The feeling, â€œIt has begun! Here it is!â€ was seen even on Prince
BagratiÃ³nâ€™s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.
Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face
and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking
andwith a beaming but rather
cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of ZherkÃ³vâ€™s
joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.

â€œIt is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,â€ said the staff officer.
(He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a
prince, but could not get it quite right.)

By this time they were all approaching TÃºshinâ€™s battery, and a ball
struck the ground in front of them.

â€œWhatstanding
by the ammunition wagon.

He asked, â€œWhose company?â€ but he really meant, â€œAre you
frightened here?â€ and the artilleryman understood him.

â€œCaptain TÃºshinâ€™s, your excellency!â€ shouted the red-haired,
freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.

â€œYes, yes,â€ muttered BagratiÃ³n as if considering something, and he
rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.

As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and ho the officerâ€™s
report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended
before him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the
height on which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the
rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was
heard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of
the suite pointed out to BagratiÃ³n a French column that was outflanking
us. To the left the hor command
(the one who had paraded his regiment before KutÃºzov at Braunau) that
he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear,
as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemyâ€™s
attack very long. About TÃºshin and the battalion that had been in
support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened
attentively to BagratiÃ³nâ€™s colloquies with the commanding officers
and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had
that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering.
Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men
lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were
unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and
despite the generalâ€™s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating.
In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
smng that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and
could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his
regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement
of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted â€œCavalry!â€ and
our men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry
which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into thess to his words. The staff
officer joined in the colonelâ€™s appeals, but BagratiÃ³n did not reply;
he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room
for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain
of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began
to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the
hill opposite, with the French moving about on it, opened out before
them. All eyes fastenedhe superior officers and now back at the men
without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as
if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander
in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he
was happy. â€œLeft... left... left...â€ he seemed to repeat to himself
at each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied
faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched
id marched past him and
dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his
felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the
French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.

â€œForward, with God!â€ said BagratiÃ³n, in a resolute, sonorous voice,
turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms,
he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of
a cavalryman. he rear was hurried and noisy, but the
different companies did not get mixed. But our leftâ€”which consisted
of the AzÃ³v and PodÃ³lsk infantry and the PÃ¡vlograd hussarsâ€”was
simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under
Lannes and was thrown into confusion. BagratiÃ³n had sent ZherkÃ³v
to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat
immediately.

ZherkÃ³v, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about
and gallrative. Cannon and musketry, mingling
together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes
of Lannesâ€™ sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and
forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in
command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and
having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the
PÃ¡vlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows but with
secret malevolence in te another like two
fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs
of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As
there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for
it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire,
they would have remained there for a long time testing each otherâ€™s
courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry
and a muffled shout almoseeling that at last
the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
often heard from his fellow hussars.

â€œFoâ€™ward, with God, lads!â€ rang out DenÃ­sovâ€™s voice. â€œAt a
twot foâ€™ward!â€

The horsesâ€™ croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the
reins and started of his own accord.

Before him, on the right, RostÃ³v saw the front lines of his hussars and
still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly alone in the middle of a
field. Instead of the moving horses and hussarsâ€™ backs, he saw nothing
before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There
was warm blood under his arm. â€œNo, I am wounded and the horse is
killed.â€ Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his
riderâ€™s leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could
not rise. RostÃ³v also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache
having become entangled inunning? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone
is so fond of?â€ He remembered his motherâ€™s love for him, and his
familyâ€™s, and his friendsâ€™, and the enemyâ€™s intention to kill him
seemed impossible. â€œBut perhaps they may do it!â€ For more than ten
seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation.
The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so
close that the expression of his face could be seenched the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.





CHAPTER XX

The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts
of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and
retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the
senseless cry, â€œCut off!â€ that is so terrible in battle, and that
word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.

â€œSurrounded! Cut off? Weâ€™re lost!â€ shouted  to his former self, and the flourishing of
his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the
air, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate
of battles was evidently culminating in a panic.

The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that
moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent
reason, ran back and g notice of the
soldier.

â€œYour excellency, here are two trophies,â€ said DÃ³lokhov, pointing
to the French sword and pouch. â€œI have taken an officer prisoner. I
stopped the company.â€ DÃ³lokhov breathed heavily from weariness and
spoke in abrupt sentences. â€œThe whole company can bear witness. I beg
you will remember this, your excellency!â€

â€œAll right, all right,â€ replied the commander, and turned to Major
EkonÃ³mov.

But DÃ³lokhov did not go away;  As if urging each other on, the soldiers
cried at each shot: â€œFine! Thatâ€™s good! Look at it... Grand!â€ The
fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns
that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge
for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village
and began firing them at TÃºshinâ€™s battery.

In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in
successfully cannonading the Frenew more and
more animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and
turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always
the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers,
for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an
artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad
as their officerâ€”all looked at their commander like children in an
embarrassing situation, and the expression on hloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by
the wind.

â€œNow look out for the ball... weâ€™ll throw it back.â€

â€œWhat do you want, your honor?â€ asked an artilleryman, standing
close by, who heard him muttering.

â€œNothing... only a shell...â€ he answered.

â€œCome along, our MatvÃ©vna!â€ he said to himself. â€œMatvÃ©vnaâ€ *
was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which
was large and of an old pattern. The Frenped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.

â€œRetire! All to retire!â€ he shouted from a distance.

The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same
order.

It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space
where TÃºshinâ€™s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a
broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses.
Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay
s
cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the
right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as TÃºshin with his guns,
continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range
of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff,
among them the staff officer and ZherkÃ³v, who had been twice sent to
TÃºshinâ€™s battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one
another, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to howrom which they had removed the dead officer.
The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his
breeches and arm.

â€œWhat, are you wounded, my lad?â€ said TÃºshin, approaching the gun
on which RostÃ³v sat.

â€œNo, itâ€™s a sprain.â€

â€œThen what is this blood on the gun carriage?â€ inquired TÃºshin.

â€œIt was the officer, your honor, stained it,â€ answered the
artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if
apologizing fors of the
wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness
of the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their
groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night.
After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on
a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing:
â€œWhat did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?â€ came
eager questions from all sides. The whole mh the
gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.
RostÃ³v looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and
around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held
his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.

â€œYou donâ€™t mind your honor?â€ he asked TÃºshin. â€œIâ€™ve lost my
company, your honor. I donâ€™t know where... such bad luck!â€

With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up  greatcoat and pulling it straight,
walked away from the fire.

Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared
for him, Prince BagratiÃ³n sat at dinner, talking with some commanding
officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with
the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the
general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a
glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with then so? Could one possibly make out amid all that
confusion what did or did not happen?

â€œBy the way, your excellency, I should inform you,â€ he
continuedâ€”remembering DÃ³lokhovâ€™s conversation with KutÃºzov and his
last interview with the gentleman-rankerâ€”â€œthat Private DÃ³lokhov,
who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my
presence and particularly distinguished himself.â€

â€œI saw the PÃ¡vlograd hussars attack there, your excellency missed one another,â€ said the staff
officer, with a smile to BolkÃ³nski.

â€œI had not the pleasure of seeing you,â€ said Prince Andrew, coldly
and abruptly.

All were silent. TÃºshin appeared at the threshold and made his way
timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the
generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the
sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and
stumbled over it. Several d out, two
guns smashed, and no supports at all.â€

Prince BagratiÃ³n and TÃºshin looked with equal intentness at
BolkÃ³nski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.

â€œAnd, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,â€ he
continued, â€œwe owe todayâ€™s success chiefly to the action of that
battery and the heroic endurance of Captain TÃºshin and his company,â€
and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.

Prince BagratiÃ³n looked this soldier
that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and
always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but
they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hairâ€™s breadth.
It would not acheâ€”it would be wellâ€”if only they did not pull it, but
it was impossible to get rid of them.

He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less
than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of fallie whole interest of his life,
were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the
circumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not merely one
or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves,
some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He
did not, for instance, say to himself: â€œThis man now has influence, I
must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special
grant.â€ Nor did heovernment offices, the purpose of
which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his
estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not
even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended
and grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different
peopleâ€”businessmen, relations, and acquaintances alikeâ€”were all
disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering
manner: they were all evidently firdeceased,â€ said Prince VasÃ­li to him, handing him
a deed to sign for the princessâ€™ benefit.

Prince VasÃ­li had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw
this boneâ€”a bill for thirty thousand rublesâ€”to the poor princess
that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of
the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess
grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate to him,
especially the yo ought to be done in a tone of
weariness and assurance, as if he were adding every time: â€œYou know
I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that
I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I
propose is the only thing possible.â€

â€œWell, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,â€ said Prince
VasÃ­li one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierreâ€™s elbow,
speaking as if he were saying something which had long sincand will keep it;
you wonâ€™t require it. Weâ€™ll go into the accounts later.â€

By â€œwhat was due from the RyazÃ¡n estateâ€ Prince VasÃ­li meant
several thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierreâ€™s peasants,
which the prince had retained for himself.

In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of
gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the
rank (for he did nothing), that Prince VasÃ­li had procured for him,
and a modesty.

In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna
PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added:
â€œYou will find the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne here, whom it is always
delightful to see.â€

When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some
link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
HÃ©lÃ¨ne, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were
being imposed on him whi
â€œWait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.â€
(She glanced at HÃ©lÃ¨ne and smiled at her.) â€œMy dear HÃ©lÃ¨ne, be
charitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for
ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count
who will not refuse to accompany you.â€

The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna PÃ¡vlovna detained Pierre, looking
as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.

â€œIsnâ€™t she exquisi beautiful bright smile that she gave
to everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little
meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just
speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierreâ€™s
father, Count BezÃºkhov, and showed them her own box. Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne
asked to see the portrait of the auntâ€™s husband on the box lid.

â€œThat is probably the work of Vinesse,â€ said Pierre, mentioning
a celebrated miniatuhad been standing at the
altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not
even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why,
that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.

Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see
her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every
day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more
than a man who has been looking anot look at
HÃ©lÃ¨ne nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He
muttered something and colored.

When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what
had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that
the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned
he had said absent-mindedly: â€œYes, sheâ€™s good looking,â€ he had
understood that this woman might belong to him.

â€œBut sheâ€™s stuy wrong and that he ought not to do. But at
the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another
part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.





CHAPTER II

In November, 1805, Prince VasÃ­li had to go on a tour of inspection
in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to
visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole
where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nturn to his former conception of her, that he
could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible
thing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have
been able to free himself but that Prince VasÃ­li (who had rarely before
given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening
party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil
the general pleasure and disappoint everyoneâ€™s expectation. Prince
VasÃ­liere was something more significant than in the general
smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was
waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that
sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror
seized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during
that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to
that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: â€œWhat am I dolivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the
silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladiesâ€™ toilets and the gold
and silver of the menâ€™s epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved
round the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with
the animated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table, the
old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her
passionately, at which she laughed; at the other could beears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.â€

â€œKuzmÃ­ch... From all sides... and then tears,â€ someone repeated
laughing.

â€œDonâ€™t be unkind,â€ cried Anna PÃ¡vlovna from her end of the table
holding up a threatening finger. â€œHe is such a worthy and excellent
man, our dear VyazmÃ­tinov....â€

Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the
honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the
influence of has come for these young ones to
be thus boldly, provocatively happy.â€ â€œAnd what nonsense all this is
that I am saying!â€ thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces
of the lovers. â€œThatâ€™s happiness!â€

Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that
society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling
dominated everything else and soared d of a Helen. â€œBut no doubt it always is and must be so!â€
he consoled himself. â€œAnd besides, what have I done to bring it about?
How did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince VasÃ­li. Then there
was nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards
with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it
begin, when did it all come about?â€ And here he was sitting by her
side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nelet her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful
silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his
diplomatic career in comparison with Pierreâ€™s happiness. The old
general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. â€œOh, the
old fool,â€ he thought. â€œThat Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne will be beautiful
still when sheâ€™s fifty.â€

â€œI think I may congratulate you,â€ whispered Anna PÃ¡vlovna to the
old princess, kissing her soundly. â€œâ€œWell, LÃ«lya?â€ he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and
addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to
parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince
VasÃ­li had only acquired by imitating other parents.

And he again turned to Pierre.

â€œSergÃ©y KuzmÃ­châ€”From all sidesâ€”â€ he said, unbuttoning the top
button of his waistcoat.

Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
aboe.

â€œStill the same,â€ she said to her husband.

Prince VasÃ­li frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his
face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking
himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went
past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went
joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre
rose in alarm on seeing it.

â€œThank God!â€ said Prince VasÃiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but
with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his
lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,
unpleasantly excited expression.

â€œIt is too late now, itâ€™s done; besides I love her,â€ thought
Pierre.

â€œJe vous aime!â€ * he said, remembering what has to be said at such
moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.

    * â€ way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into
a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned
him. On the day of Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s arrival, Prince BolkÃ³nski was
particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad
temper because Prince VasÃ­li was coming, or whether his being in a bad
temper made him specially annoyed at Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s visit, he was
in a bad temper, and in the morning TÃ­khon had already advised tarsh voice. â€œThe road is not swept for the princess my
daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!â€

â€œYour honor, I thought...â€

â€œYou thought!â€ shouted the prince, his words coming more and more
rapidly and indistinctly. â€œYou thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...
Iâ€™ll teach you to think!â€ and lifting his stick he swung it and
would have hit AlpÃ¡tych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively
avoided the blow. â€œThought... Blaural in her
state.â€

â€œHm! Hm!â€ muttered the prince, sitting down.

His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he
flung it away. TÃ­khon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little
princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.

â€œI am afraid for the baby,â€ she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:
â€œHeaven knows what a fright might do.â€

I dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess
was sitting at a small table, chattering with MÃ¡sha, her maid. She grew
pale on seeing her father-in-law.

She was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks
had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.

â€œYes, I feel a kind of oppression,â€ she said in reply to the
princeâ€™s question as to how she felt.

â€œDo you want anything?â€

â€œNo, merci, mon pÃ¨re.â€

air natural to
him. Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked
round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
entered, as if to say: â€œYes, thatâ€™s how I want you to look.â€

â€œI say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?â€ Anatole asked,
as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been
mentioned during the journey.

â€œEnough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious
,
but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her
face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded
outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still
more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch
had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s toilet which rendered her
fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.

â€œWhat! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?â€ sheght, itâ€™s not becoming!â€

It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary
that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little
princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on
the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that
the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that
however they might chanrs, Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s, and Katieâ€™s, who
was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping
of birds.

â€œNo, leave me alone,â€ said Princess Mary.

Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful
eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at
them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.

â€œAt les daughterâ€”at her
own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
child. â€œBut no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,â€ she thought.

â€œPlease come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,â€ came the
maidâ€™s voice at the door.

She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and
before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her
eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by ay
in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle
Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels,
the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess,
indicating her to the gentlemen, said: â€œVoilÃ  Marie!â€ Princess Mary
saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s face,
serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling
again, and the little princess curiously noting  foot, and smilingly examined the
princessâ€™ hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for
a very long time. â€œIf anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him
talk, but I donâ€™t want to,â€ he seemed to say. Besides this, in his
behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in
them curiosity, awe, and even loveâ€”a supercilious consciousness of
his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: â€œI know you, I know
you, but wh Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

â€œAh, but you wonâ€™t talk politics to me like Annette!â€

â€œAnd our little tea table?â€

â€œOh, yes!â€

â€œWhy is it you were never at Annetteâ€™s?â€ the little princess asked
Anatole. â€œAh, I know, I know,â€ she said with a sly glance, â€œyour
brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!â€ and she shook her
finger at him, â€œI have even heard of your doings in Paris!â€

â€œAnd didnâ€™t Hippolyte tell you?â€ asked Prince VasÃ­on he always tried to stifle, one about
which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever
bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The
prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand
that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only
with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without
Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to
him. â€œAnd How dâ€™ye do? Glad to see you!â€

â€œFriendship laughs at distance,â€ began Prince VasÃ­li in his usual
rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. â€œHere is my second son; please
love and befriend him.â€

Prince BolkÃ³nski surveyed Anatole.

â€œFine young fellow! Fine young fellow!â€ he said. â€œWell, come and
kiss me,â€ and he offered his cheek.

Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect
composure, waiting for a display of the ecc smile
beside the old prince.

â€œWell, my dear boy, I hear youâ€™ve been educated abroad, not taught
to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me,
my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?â€ asked the old man,
scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.

â€œNo, I have been transferred to the line,â€ said Anatole, hardly able
to restrain his laughter.

â€œAh! Thatâ€™s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the
Tsar and tce snorted. â€œLet her marry, itâ€™s all the
same to me!â€ he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting
from his son.

â€œI will tell you frankly,â€ said Prince VasÃ­li in the tone of
a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so
keen-sighted a companion. â€œYou know, you see right through people.
Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent
son or kinsman.â€

â€œAll right, all right, weâ€™ll see!â€

As alher life to serving Prince BolkÃ³nski, to reading
aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle
Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to
appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed,
ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her
off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew
a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she
liked to repeauddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.

After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was
asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits,
came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle
Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.
Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and
the look she felt upon her made that world still moreen your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!â€ she said. And
smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.





CHAPTER V

They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he
got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.

â€œIs he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kindâ€”yes,
kind, that is the chief thing,â€ thought Princess Mary; and fear, which
sheprince felt as though he
had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed
because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he
loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider
the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but
instead of that he only excited himself more and more.

â€œThe first man that turns upâ€”she forgets her father and everything
else, runs upstairs and does up her hahis
masterâ€™s thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince
VasÃ­li and his son.

â€œThey have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.â€

â€œNo good... no good...â€ said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his
feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing
gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.

Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne,
they quite understood one another as to the  as a â€œpupilâ€) â€œfor the sake of my
beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account
and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.â€

â€œHow am I to understand you, mon pÃ¨re?â€ said the princess, growing
pale and then blushing.

â€œHow understand me!â€ cried her father angrily. â€œPrince VasÃ­li
finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you
on his pupilâ€™s behalf. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s to be understood! â€˜Hour room, think it
over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no.
I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better
think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!â€ he still shouted
when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the
study.

Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said
about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but
still it wasourienne.

â€œWhy? I love you more than ever,â€ said Princess Mary, â€œand I will
try to do all I can for your happiness.â€

â€œBut you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so
carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...â€

â€œI quite understand,â€ answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile.
â€œCalm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,â€ she said, and went
out.

Prince VasÃ­li, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snue VasÃ­li rose.

â€œMy dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never
forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching
this heart, so kind and generous? Say â€˜perhapsâ€™... The future is so
long. Say â€˜perhaps.â€™â€

â€œPrince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for
the honor, but I shall never be your sonâ€™s wife.â€

â€œWell, so thatâ€™s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have
seen you. Verliving with the RostÃ³vs.

â€œMy dear friend?â€ said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared
to sympathize in any way.

The count sobbed yet more.

â€œNikÃ³lenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling
boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How
tell the little countess!â€

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped
the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her
own eyes ling, do tell me what it is!â€

â€œNothing, my dear.â€

â€œNo, dearest, sweet one, honey, I wonâ€™t give upâ€”I know you know
something.â€

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna shook her head.

â€œYou are a little slyboots,â€ she said.

â€œA letter from NikÃ³lenka! Iâ€™m sure of it!â€ exclaimed NatÃ¡sha,
reading confirmation in Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s face.

â€œBut for Godâ€™s sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your
mamma.â€

â€œI will, I will, only tell me! You wof those Frenchmen,â€ he said. â€œWhat nasty brutes they are! Iâ€™d
have killed so many that thereâ€™d have been a heap of them.â€

â€œHold your tongue, PÃ©tya, what a goose you are!â€

â€œIâ€™m not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,â€ said
PÃ©tya.

â€œDo you remember him?â€ NatÃ¡sha suddenly asked, after a momentâ€™s
silence.

SÃ³nya smiled.

â€œDo I remember Nicholas?â€

â€œNo, SÃ³nya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly,
rro, would it be right to remind him of herself
and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on
himself?

â€œI donâ€™t know. I think if he writes, I will write too,â€ she said,
blushing.

â€œAnd you wonâ€™t feel ashamed to write to him?â€

SÃ³nya smiled.

â€œNo.â€

â€œAnd I should be ashamed to write to BorÃ­s. Iâ€™m not going to.â€

â€œWhy should you be ashamed?â€

â€œWell, I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s awkward and would make me ashamed.â€

s skill.

â€œIt is done!â€ she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the
countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and
in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.

When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his
bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait,
and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away
the bald head. VÃ©ra, NatÃ¡sha, SÃ³roofs of NikÃ³lenkaâ€™s virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how
joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom
she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who
had first learned to say â€œpearâ€ and then â€œgranny,â€ that this son
should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly
warrior doing some kind of manâ€™s work of hined officer were collected. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,
practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army
authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself
and her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand
Duke Constantine PÃ¡vlovich, who commanded the Guards. The RostÃ³vs
supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address,
and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards
there was line the Hungarian,
who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.
RostÃ³v, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought
DenÃ­sovâ€™s horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and
the sutlers. On receiving BorÃ­sâ€™ letter he rode with a fellow officer
to OlmÃ¼tz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone
to the Guardsâ€™ camp to find his old playmate. RostÃ³v had not yet had
time to get his uniformeful to him, and by
a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become
acquainted with Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski, through whom he hoped to
obtain a post on the commander in chiefâ€™s staff. Berg and BorÃ­s,
having rested after yesterdayâ€™s march, were sitting, clean and neatly
dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them,
playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. BorÃ­s, in
the accurate way characteristic of him, was bction of the society in which they had taken
those first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both
were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.

â€œOh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if youâ€™d been to a fete,
not like us sinners of the line,â€ cried RostÃ³v, with martial swagger
and with baritone notes in his voice, new to BorÃ­s, pointing to his own
mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing RostÃ³vâ€™s loue.

â€œYes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,â€ he added.

RostÃ³v took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both
arms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he
glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the
letter.

â€œWell, theyâ€™ve sent you a tidy sum,â€ said Berg, eying the heavy
purse that sank into the sofa. â€œAs for us, Count, we get along on our
pay. I can tell you for myself...âmmendation
to BagratiÃ³n which the old countess at Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s advice had
obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take
it to its destination and make use of it.

â€œWhat nonsense! Much I need it!â€ said RostÃ³v, throwing the letter
under the table.

â€œWhy have you thrown that away?â€ asked BorÃ­s.

â€œIt is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it
for!â€

â€œWhy â€˜What the devilâ€™?â€ said BorÃ­s, pirch and
how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke
of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told
stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent
when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the
stories of the Grand Dukeâ€™s quick temper he related with gusto how in
Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter
made a tour of the regiments and was annothat was fine,â€ said RostÃ³v, smiling.

But BorÃ­s noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and
skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where
he got his wound. This pleased RostÃ³v and he began talking about it,
and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his
SchÃ¶n Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle
generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been,
as they have u cannot imagine
what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,â€ Prince
Andrew, whom BorÃ­s was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who
liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance
and being well disposed toward BorÃ­s, who had managed to please him the
day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent
with papers from KutÃºzov to the TsarÃ©vich, he looked in on BorÃ­s,
hoping to find him alone. When laterâ€ (and he looked round at RostÃ³v). â€œCome
to me after the review and we will do what is possible.â€

And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to RostÃ³v,
whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to
anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: â€œI think you were
talking of the SchÃ¶n Grabern affair? Were you there?â€

â€œI was there,â€ said RostÃ³v angrily, as if intending to insult the
aide-de-camp.

BolkÃ³nsed rising, â€œyou know my name and
where to find me, but donâ€™t forget that I do not regard either myself
or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my
advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review
I shall expect you, DrubetskÃ³y. Au revoir!â€ exclaimed Prince Andrew,
and with a bow to them both he went out.

Only when Prince Andrew was gone did RostÃ³v think of what he ought to
have said. And he was still more angrrses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the
polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with
the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the
infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the
generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn
in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and
wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the ele them, a group was seen
approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust
of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the
lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It
looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its
joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting:
â€œEyes front!â€ Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was
repeated by others from various n
â€œHurrah!â€... Then the general march, and again â€œHurrah! Hurrah!â€
growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.

Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility
seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive,
its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had
already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices,
amid the square masses of troops standing motiod the officers also: â€œI thank you all, gentlemen, I
thank you with my whole heart.â€ To RostÃ³v every word sounded like a
voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!

â€œYou have earned the St. Georgeâ€™s standards and will be worthy of
them.â€

â€œOh, to die, to die for him,â€ thought RostÃ³v.

The Tsar said something more which RostÃ³v did not hear, and the
soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted â€œHurrah!â€

RostÃ³v too, bendia ceremonial march past him, and RostÃ³v on Bedouin, recently purchased
from DenÃ­sov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadronâ€”that is,
alone and in full view of the Emperor.

Before he reached him, RostÃ³v, who was a splendid horseman, spurred
Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his
tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperorâ€™s eye
upon him, passt wishes for success, rode to OlmÃ¼tz to see
BolkÃ³nski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself
the best post he couldâ€”preferably that of adjutant to some important
personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive.
â€œIt is all very well for RostÃ³v, whose father sends him ten thousand
rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not
be anyoneâ€™s lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to
nearest
the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing.
Another, the red, stout NesvÃ­tski, lay on a bed with his arms under his
head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was
playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on
the clavichord, sang the tune. BolkÃ³nski was not there. None of these
gentlemen changed his position on seeing BorÃ­s. The one who was writing
and whom BorÃ­s addressed turned ro
ever was BorÃ­s resolved to serve in future not according to the written
code, but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having
been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general
who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the
Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.

â€œI am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about
with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey going to the commander in chief.
He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinnerâ€ (â€œThat
would not be bad as regards the unwritten code,â€ thought BorÃ­s),
â€œbut nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of
us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what weâ€™ll do: I have
a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince
DolgorÃºkov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now
KutÃºzov with his staff and alnced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive
evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed
at the councilâ€”the coming battle and the victory that would certainly
result from itâ€”no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past.
All the advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly
superior to Napoleonâ€™s, were concentrated in one place, the troops
inspired by the Emperorsâ€™ presence were eager for action. The
strat

â€œSo the attack is definitely resolved on?â€ asked BolkÃ³nski.

â€œAnd do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has
decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him
today for the Emperor.â€ DolgorÃºkov smiled significantly.

â€œIs that so? And what did he say?â€ inquired BolkÃ³nski.

â€œWhat can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time.
I tell you he is in our hands, thatâ€™s certain! But what was most
DolgorÃºkov, turning now to BorÃ­s, now to Prince
Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test MarkÃ³v, our ambassador,
purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking
at MarkÃ³v, probably expecting MarkÃ³v to pick it up for him, and how
MarkÃ³v immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without
touching Bonaparteâ€™s.

â€œDelightful!â€ said BolkÃ³nski. â€œBut I have come to you, Prince,
as a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You seide of the corridor.

â€œWho was that?â€ asked BorÃ­s.

â€œHe is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of
menâ€”the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam CzartorÃ½ski.... It
is such men as he who decide the fate of nations,â€ added BolkÃ³nski
with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.

Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of
Austerlitz, BorÃ­s was unable to see either Prince Andrew or DolgorÃ was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and
the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of
victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken
part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers,
officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed RostÃ³v going or
coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that
precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all
tour
rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was
so alien to us.

The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and RostÃ³v, being the
richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.

â€œBut donâ€™t hurt my little horse!â€ said the Alsatian good-naturedly
to RostÃ³v when the animal was handed over to the hussar.

RostÃ³v smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.

â€œAlley! Alley!â€ said the Cossack, ired.

â€œThe reserves, sire!â€ replied a voice, a very human one compared to
that which had said: â€œThe PÃ¡vlograd hussars?â€

The Emperor drew level with RostÃ³v and halted. Alexanderâ€™s face was
even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It
shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested
the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face
of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the sn time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite
of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a
different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending
to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The
wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity
to the Emperor shocked RostÃ³v. RostÃ³v saw how the Emperorâ€™s rather
rou health and to the certain defeat of the
French!â€

â€œIf we fought before,â€ he said, â€œnot letting the French pass, as
at SchÃ¶n Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We
will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not
saying it right, I have drunk a good dealâ€”but that is how I feel, and
so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!â€

â€œHurrah!â€ rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.

And  triumph. And he was not the only man to
experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in
love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the
Russian arms.





CHAPTER XI

The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,
was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops
near by the news spread that the Emh, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz
was fought.

Till midday on the nineteenth, the activityâ€”the eager talk, running to
and fro, and dispatching of adjutantsâ€”was confined to the Emperorâ€™s
headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached
KutÃºzovâ€™s headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns.
By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the
army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, eys is merely a slow and regular movement of the
hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human
activities of 160,000 Russians and Frenchâ€”all their passions, desires,
remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and
enthusiasmâ€”was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the
so-called battle of the three Emperorsâ€”that is to say, a slow movement
of the hand on the dial of human history.

Prince Andrew was on duty that day on. â€œIf he werenâ€™t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that
interview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is
so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid,
afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!â€

â€œBut tell me, what is he like, eh?â€ said Prince Andrew again.

â€œHe is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call
him â€˜Your Majesty,â€™ but who, to his chagrin, got no title fgorÃºkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not
at the map, but at Prince Andrewâ€™s face.

â€œThere will be a council of war at KutÃºzovâ€™s tonight, though; you
can say all this there,â€ remarked DolgorÃºkov.

â€œI will do so,â€ said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.

â€œWhatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?â€ said BilÃ­bin, who,
till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and
now was evidently ready with a jo commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in
chiefâ€™s and with the exception of Prince BagratiÃ³n, who declined to
come, were all there at the appointed time.

Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his
eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
and drowsy KutÃºzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be
at the head of a movf permission previously given him by KutÃºzov to be present at the
council, he remained in the room.

â€œSince Prince BagratiÃ³n is not coming, we may begin,â€ said
Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on
which an enormous map of the environs of BrÃ¼nn was spread out.

KutÃºzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over
his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair,
with his podgy old hands restkolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we
can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between
Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of
Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemyâ€™s front. For this
object it is necessary that... The first column marches... The second
column marches... The third column marches...â€ and so on, read
Weyrother.

The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.
The tall, fair-haire Langeron lifted his eyes with
an expression of perplexity, turned round to MilorÃ¡dovich as if seeking
an explanation, but meeting the latterâ€™s impressive but meaningless
gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.

â€œA geography lesson!â€ he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough
to be heard.

PrzebyszÃ©wski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his
hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in
atte
as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily
attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this
plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and
contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
be they what they might.

â€œIf he could attack us, he would have done so today,â€ said he.

â€œSo you think he is powerless?â€ said Langeron.

â€œHe has forty thousand men at most,â€ replir today, for
it is past midnightâ€”cannot now be altered,â€ said he. â€œYou have
heard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is
nothing more important...â€ he paused, â€œthan to have a good sleep.â€

He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past
midnight. Prince Andrew went out.

The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to
express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy
imprd then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had
so long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly
expresses his opinion to KutÃºzov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors.
All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to
carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a divisionâ€”stipulates that no
one is to interfere with his arrangementsâ€”leads his division to
the decisive point, and gains the victory alone. â€œBut death and
suffteasing KutÃºzovâ€™s old cook whom Prince Andrew knew,
and who was called Tit. He was saying, â€œTit, I say, Tit!â€

â€œWell?â€ returned the old man.

â€œGo, Tit, thresh a bit!â€ said the wag.

â€œOh, go to the devil!â€ called out a voice, drowned by the laughter
of the orderlies and servants.

â€œAll the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I
value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this
mist!â€





CHAPmask his deceivers!â€ And in order to realize vividly his love
devotion to the sovereign, RostÃ³v pictured to himself an enemy or a
deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom
he would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout
aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.

â€œWhere am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and
watchwordâ€”shaft, OlmÃ¼tz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in
reserve tomorrow,â€ ! NatÃ¡sha... sabretache...
saber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along
the TverskÃ¡ya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about
him too, just opposite GÃºryevâ€™s house... Old GÃºryev.... Oh, but
DenÃ­sovâ€™s a fine fellow. But thatâ€™s all nonsense. The chief thing
is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to say
something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But thatâ€™s
nonsense, the chief thinwed the frozen ground,
pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting
grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army
of several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and
farther, probably along the line of the French camp. RostÃ³v no longer
wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a
stimulating effect on him. â€œVive lâ€™Empereur! lâ€™Empereur!â€ he now
heard distinctly.

â€œThey creplied
RostÃ³v.

BagratiÃ³n stopped and, before replying, tried to see RostÃ³vâ€™s face
in the mist.

â€œWell, go and see,â€ he said, after a pause.

â€œYes, sir.â€

RostÃ³v spurred his horse, called to Sergeant FÃ©dchenko and two other
hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction
from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be
riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty
distance d the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
different tones. RostÃ³v reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen,
like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. â€œWell, some
more! Some more!â€ a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no more
shots came.

Only when approaching BagratiÃ³n did RostÃ³v let his horse gallop again,
and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.

DolgorÃºkov was still insisting that the French had retreated ing him,
lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, â€œVive lâ€™Empereur!â€
Napoleonâ€™s proclamation was as follows:

Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at
HollabrÃ¼nn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we
occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on
the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct
yoea and breakfasting, the
soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to
warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they
did not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides
were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds
of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near
a commanding officerâ€™s quands in the moral
atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive
and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of
battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning
what is going on around them.

The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and levelult to define, but it
certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly,
and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been
alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before
this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as
it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
occasioned by the sausvexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
Germans.

The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was
moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center
was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in
front of the infantry, who had to wait.

At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a
Russian general.of what was
going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed,
six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one
knew till after eight oâ€™clock.

It was nine oâ€™clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea
down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon
stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was
a clear blue sky, and the sunâ€™s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night,
by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all
indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away
in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted
the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already
sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not
begin the engagement.

Today was a great day for himâ€”the annioremost regiment and gave
them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead
that column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he
halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the
commander in chiefâ€™s suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement
and irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of
a long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of
his Toulon, or his brid
some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably
was, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were
entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and
then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses
of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and
behind moved infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end of
the village letting the troops pass by him. That ill not answering
the Austrian adjutant, he addressed BolkÃ³nski.

â€œGo, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the
village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.â€

Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.

â€œAnd ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,â€ he added. â€œWhat
are they doing? What are they doing?â€ he murmured to himself, still
not replying to the Austrian.

Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.
rs of the regiment in front
of which KutÃºzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one
side and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped
what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them
rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with
white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who
was in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors
followed by theilong faced young man, sat very
erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and
preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked
some questionâ€”â€œMost likely he is asking at what oâ€™clock they
started,â€ thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with
a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at BrÃ¼nn.
In the Emperorsâ€™ suite were the picked young orderly officers of the
Guard and line regimeo look about him and did not listen.

â€œThat is just why I do not begin, sire,â€ said KutÃºzov in a
resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being
heard, and again something in his face twitchedâ€”â€œThat is just why
I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the
Empressâ€™ Field,â€ said he clearly and distinctly.

In the Emperorâ€™s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
dissatisfaction and reproach. â€œOld thougheled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little
behind the Emperor. The Ãpsheron men, excited by the Tsarâ€™s presence,
passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk
pace.

â€œLads!â€ shouted MilorÃ¡dovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery
voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of
battle, and by the sight of the gallant Ãpsherons, his comrades in
SuvÃ³rovâ€™s time, now passing so gallantly before the Empe to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.

â€œLook, look!â€ said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the
distance, but down the hill before him. â€œItâ€™s the French!â€

The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying
to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces
suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a
mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
front of uce Andrew forced his way to him.

â€œYou are wounded?â€ he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of
his lower jaw.

â€œThe wound is not here, it is there!â€ said KutÃºzov, pressing the
handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers.
â€œStop them!â€ he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing
that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the
right.

A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore himsecond lieutenant who was holding the
flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the
muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without
orders.

â€œOh! Oh! Oh!â€ groaned KutÃºzov despairingly and looked around....
â€œBolkÃ³nski!â€ he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness
of the feebleness of age, â€œBolkÃ³nski!â€ he whispered, pointing to
the disordered battalion and at the enemy, â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€

But bem: he looked only at what was going on in front
of himâ€”at the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired
gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while
a French soldier tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the
distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who
evidently did not realize what they were doing.

â€œWhat are they about?â€ thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them.
â€œWhy doesnâ€™t the red-haired gw was it I did not see that
lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All
is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing,
nothing, but that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but
quiet and peace. Thank God!...â€





CHAPTER XVII

On our right flank commanded by BagratiÃ³n, at nine oâ€™clock the battle
had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to DolgorÃºkovâ€™s demand to
commence the action, and wishing orse under him, and his heart was full of
joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein
and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of
BagratiÃ³nâ€™s troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were
standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by UvÃ¡rovâ€™s
cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle;
having passed UvÃ¡rovâ€™s cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon
and musketryeady in action.

â€œHow it will be there I donâ€™t know, but all will be well!â€ thought
RostÃ³v.

After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the
line (the Guards) was already in action.

â€œSo much the better! I shall see it close,â€ he thought.

He was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came
galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered
ranks were returning from the attack. RostÃ³v got out of their wav and his Bedouin over
(RostÃ³v felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men
and horses) had it not occurred to RostÃ³v to flourish his whip before
the eyes of the Guardsmanâ€™s horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen
hands high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman
drove his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail
and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse
Guards passed RostÃ³v befotacked!â€ said
BorÃ­s with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been
under fire for the first time.

RostÃ³v stopped.

â€œHave you?â€ he said. â€œWell, how did it go?â€

â€œWe drove them back!â€ said BorÃ­s with animation, growing talkative.
â€œCan you imagine it?â€ and he began describing how the Guards, having
taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were
Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon ballnt of him and behind our troops,
where he could never have expected the enemy to be.

â€œWhat can it be?â€ he thought. â€œThe enemy in the rear of our army?
Impossible!â€ And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
and for the issue of the whole battle. â€œBut be that what it may,â€
he reflected, â€œthere is no riding round it now. I must look for the
commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
the rest.â€

The forebodinhe commander in chief, he could not,
did not wish to, believe that.





CHAPTER XVIII

RostÃ³v had been ordered to look for KutÃºzov and the Emperor near the
village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer
were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He
urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but
the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on
which he had come out was throRostÃ³v let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded
officer passing by addressed him:

â€œWho is it you want?â€ he asked. â€œThe commander in chief? He was
killed by a cannon ballâ€”struck in the breast before our regiment.â€

â€œNot killedâ€”wounded!â€ another officer corrected him.

â€œWho? KutÃºzov?â€ asked RostÃ³v.

â€œNot KutÃºzov, but whatâ€™s his nameâ€”well, never mind... there are
not many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all  all these suffering men, and he felt afraidâ€”afraid not
for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not
stand the sight of these unfortunates.

The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant
riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The
sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
him merged in RostÃ³vâ€™s me had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his
horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only
a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horseâ€™s hind hoofs.
Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially
addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting
that he should do the same. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar
to RostÃ³v and involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of
refs dry at the mere sight
of him?â€ Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor
that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall. Those
speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the
most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally
when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic
deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.

â€œBesides how can I ask ther and he had not
made use of it.... â€œWhat have I done?â€ thought he. And he turned
round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but
there was no one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages
were passing by. From one of the drivers he learned that KutÃºzovâ€™s
staff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to.
RostÃ³v followed them. In front of him walked KutÃºzovâ€™s groom leading
horses in horsecloths. Then came a chat dam over which for
so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully
driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty
with flour whitening their cartsâ€”on that narrow dam amid the wagons
and the cannon, under the horsesâ€™ hoofs and between the wagon wheels,
men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one
another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to
move on a few steps and be his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the
bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the
entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address
DÃ³lokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general fell
from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of
raising him.

â€œGet onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! 
how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was
alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.

â€œWhere is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw
today?â€ was his first thought. â€œAnd I did not know this suffering
either,â€ he thought. â€œYes, I did not know anything, anything at all
till now. But where am I?â€

He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices
speaking French. He openhim, but he took no notice of them and at once
forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,
and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it
was Napoleonâ€”his heroâ€”but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him
such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now
between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over
it. At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over
hisaid another officer.

â€œAll the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor
Alexanderâ€™s Guards,â€ said the first one, indicating a Russian
officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.

BolkÃ³nski recognized Prince RepnÃ­n whom he had met in Petersburg
society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of
the Horse Guards.

Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.

â€œWhich is the senior?â€ he asked, on sgrossed Napoleon, so mean did his
hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear,
compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and
understood, that he could not answer him.

Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,
suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into
Napoleonâ€™s eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificaot only cannot address but which I cannot even express in
wordsâ€”the Great All or Nothing-â€ said he to himself, â€œor to
that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing
certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I
understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but
all-important.â€

The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;
his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of way to Moscow, but lay
at the bottom of the sleigh beside RostÃ³v, who grew more and more
impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.

â€œHow much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,
shops, bakersâ€™ signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!â€ thought
RostÃ³v, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and
they had entered Moscow.

â€œDenÃ­sov! Weâ€™re here! Heâ€™s asleep,â€ he added, leaning forward
with his whole body as if in thatch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He
sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house
stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it.
There was no one in the hall. â€œOh God! Is everyone all right?â€
he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then
immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of
the familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always
angered the cand yet another creature of the same
kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing,
more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was
Papa, which NatÃ¡sha, and which PÃ©tya. Everyone shouted, talked, and
kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed
that.

â€œAnd I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...â€

â€œHere he is... our own... KÃ³lya, * dear fellow... How he has
changed!... Where are thely pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussarâ€™s jacket. DenÃ­sov,
who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped
his eyes at the sight.

â€œVasÃ­li DenÃ­sov, your sonâ€™s friend,â€ he said, introducing
himself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.

â€œYou are most welcome! I know, I know,â€ said the count, kissing and
embracing DenÃ­sov. â€œNicholas wrote us... NatÃ¡sha, VÃ©ra, look! Here
is DenÃ­sov!â€

The same happy, rar and a smell of tobacco.

â€œHallo, GwÃ­skaâ€”my pipe!â€ came VasÃ­li DenÃ­sovâ€™s husky voice.
â€œWostÃ³v, get up!â€

RostÃ³v, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his
disheveled head from the hot pillow.

â€œWhy, is it late?â€

â€œLate! Itâ€™s nearly ten oâ€™clock,â€ answered NatÃ¡shaâ€™s voice.
A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of
girlsâ€™ voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a
crack and theom, where they began talking. They hardly gave
one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand
little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves. NatÃ¡sha
laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what
they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable
to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.

â€œOh, how nice, how splendid!â€ she said to everything.

RostÃ³v felt that, roof of love did not seem
to him senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it.

â€œWell, and is that all?â€ he asked.

â€œWe are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just
nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it
for life, but I donâ€™t understand that, I forget quickly.â€

â€œWell, what then?â€

â€œWell, she loves me and you like that.â€

NatÃ¡sha suddenly flushed.

â€œWhy, you remember before you we over
later on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!â€

â€œWell, and are you still true to BorÃ­s?â€ he continued.

â€œOh, what nonsense!â€ cried NatÃ¡sha, laughing. â€œI donâ€™t think
about him or anyone else, and I donâ€™t want anything of the kind.â€

â€œDear me! Then what are you up to now?â€

â€œNow?â€ repeated NatÃ¡sha, and a happy smile lit up her face. â€œHave
you seen Duport?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œNot seen Duportâ€”the famous dancer? Well then, you wonâ€™tng room, he reddened. He did not know
how to behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of
meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not
be done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was
looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave
with her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as
youâ€”SÃ³nya. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender
kisses. Her looks aybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough
that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,
acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the
latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the
latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,
passed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself
to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be
at home again.ry pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was
at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no
time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and
prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things. When he
thought of SÃ³nya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself,
â€œAh, there will be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom
I do not yet know. There will be time enough to think ve cocksâ€™ comb in the turtle soup, you
know!â€

â€œShall we have three cold dishes then?â€ asked the cook.

The count considered.

â€œWe canâ€™t have lessâ€”yes, three... the mayonnaise, thatâ€™s one,â€
said he, bending down a finger.

â€œThen am I to order those large sterlets?â€ asked the steward.

â€œYes, it canâ€™t be helped if they wonâ€™t take less. Ah, dear me! I
was forgetting. We must have another entrÃ©e. Ah, goodness gracious!â€
he clutched at nd respectful
expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
son.

â€œWhat have the young people come to nowadays, eh, FeoktÃ­st?â€ said
he. â€œLaughing at us old fellows!â€

â€œThatâ€™s so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good
dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, thatâ€™s not their
business!â€

â€œThatâ€™s it, thatâ€™s it!â€ exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing
his son by both hands, he cried, â€œNow Iâ€™ve 
him?â€ he asked.

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted
on her face.

â€œAh, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,â€ she said. â€œIf what
we hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing
when we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul
as young BezÃºkhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give
him what consolation I can.â€

â€œWh-what is the matter?â€ asked both the  men who set the tone
in conversationâ€”Count RostopchÃ­n, Prince YÃºri DolgorÃºkov, ValÃºev,
Count MarkÃ³v, and Prince VyÃ¡zemskiâ€”did not show themselves at the
club, but met in private houses in intimate circles, and the
Moscovites who took their opinions from othersâ€”IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v among
themâ€”remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject
of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was
wrong and that to discuss the bad ne name of
SuvÃ³rov. Moreover, paying such honor to BagratiÃ³n was the best way of
expressing disapproval and dislike of KutÃºzov.

â€œHad there been no BagratiÃ³n, it would have been necessary to
invent him,â€ said the wit ShinshÃ­n, parodying the words of Voltaire.
KutÃºzov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers,
calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.

All Moscow repeated Prince DolgorÃºkovâ€™s saying: â€œIf you go on
modeling and modeliment in order
to offer their services. Most of those present were elderly, respected
men with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures
and voices. This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
places and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present
were casual guestsâ€”chiefly young men, among whom were DenÃ­sov,
RostÃ³v, and DÃ³lokhovâ€”who was now again an officer in the SemÃ«nov
regiment. The faces of these young peopuncil of War at which SuvÃ³rov crowed like a cock in reply to
the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. ShinshÃ­n, standing close
by, tried to make a joke, saying that KutÃºzov had evidently failed to
learn from SuvÃ³rov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him
feel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of
KutÃºzov.

Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, hurried and preoccupiedof St. George on his left breast. Evidently just
before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed,
which changed his appearance for the worse. There was something naÃ¯vely
festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile
features, gave him a rather comical expression. BekleshÃ«v and Theodore
UvÃ¡rov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him,
as the guest of honor, to enter first. BagratiÃ³n was embarrassed, not
d and printed in the heroâ€™s honor. BagratiÃ³n, on seeing the
salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes
demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in their power, he
resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and
reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him. Someone
obligingly took the dish from BagratiÃ³n (or he would, it seemed, have
held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his
aepest where the land lies lowest.

Just before dinner, Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v presented his son to BagratiÃ³n,
who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward,
as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count IlyÃ¡ looked joyfully
and proudly around while BagratiÃ³n spoke to his son.

Nicholas RostÃ³v, with DenÃ­sov and his new acquaintance, DÃ³lokhov, sat
almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince
NesvÃ­tski. Count Emperor!â€ he roared, â€œHurrah!â€ and
emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many followed
his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time. When the
voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody
sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging
remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside
his plate, and proposed a toast, â€œTo the health of the hero of our
last campa

The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the
princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning DÃ³lokhovâ€™s intimacy with
his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which
in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw
badly through his spectacles, but that his wifeâ€™s connection with
DÃ³lokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely
disbelieved both the princessâ€™ hints and the letteeve it.â€
He remembered the expression DÃ³lokhovâ€™s face assumed in his moments
of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them
into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any
reason, or shot a post-boyâ€™s horse with a pistol. That expression
was often on DÃ³lokhovâ€™s face when looking at him. â€œYes, he is a
bully,â€ thought Pierre, â€œto kill a man means nothing to him. It must
seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, aRostÃ³v.

â€œConfound him, heâ€™s a fool!â€ said RostÃ³v.

â€œOne should make up to the husbands of pretty women,â€ said DenÃ­sov.

Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking
about him. He reddened and turned away.

â€œWell, now to the health of handsome women!â€ said DÃ³lokhov, and
with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of
his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.

â€œHereâ€™s to the health of lovelative.
He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite DenÃ­sovâ€™s
request that he would take no part in the matter, RostÃ³v agreed to be
DÃ³lokhovâ€™s second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for
the duel with NesvÃ­tski, BezÃºkhovâ€™s second. Pierre went home, but
RostÃ³v with DÃ³lokhov and DenÃ­sov stayed on at the club till late,
listening to the gypsies and other singers.

â€œWell then, till tomorrow at SokÃ³lniki,â€ said DÃ³lokhov, as he ... â€œI should perhaps have done the same thing in his
place,â€ thought Pierre. â€œItâ€™s even certain that I should have done
the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or
he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Canâ€™t I go away from
here, run away, bury myself somewhere?â€ passed through his mind. But
just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a
particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the res handâ€”a fact that he
did not wish to confess.

â€œOh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,â€ said he.

â€œNo apologies, none whatever,â€ said DÃ³lokhov to DenÃ­sov (who on
his side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to
the appointed place.

The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,
where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest
covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up
â€œSo I can fire when I like!â€ said Pierre, and at the word
â€œthree,â€ he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and
stepping into the deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at
armâ€™s length, apparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left
hand he held carefully back, because he wished to support his right
hand with it and knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and
strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his fa firm center of gravity. He sucked
and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still
smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his
remaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.

â€œSideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!â€ ejaculated NesvÃ­tski.

â€œCover yourself!â€ even DenÃ­sov cried to his adversary.

Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs
helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chined to RostÃ³v that he was
living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it.
He implored RostÃ³v to go on and prepare her.

RostÃ³v went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise
learned that DÃ³lokhov the brawler, DÃ³lokhov the bully, lived in Moscow
with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate
of sons and brothers.





CHAPTER VI

Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersbâ€ he thought. â€œI felt then that
it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.â€

He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.
Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of
how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his
study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head
steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at
his dressing gown and ht up in the most aristocratic circles.

â€œIâ€™m not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous
promener,â€ * she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with
young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not
love her.

    * â€œYou clear out of this.â€


â€œYes, I never loved her,â€ said he to himself; â€œI knew she was a
depraved woman,â€ he repeated, â€œbut dared not admit it to myself.
And now thereâ€™s DÃ³lokhov sitting s heart and had again to get up and move about and break
and tear whatever came to his hand. â€œWhy did I tell her that â€˜Je
vous aimeâ€™?â€ he kept repeating to himself. And when he had said it
for the tenth time, MoliÃ¨reâ€™s words: â€œMais que diable allait-il
faire dans cette galÃ¨re?â€ * occurred to him, and he began to laugh at
himself.

      * â€œBut what the devil was he doing in that galley?â€


In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up the valet to
go.

â€œWell, whatâ€™s this now? What have you been up to now, I should like
to know?â€ she asked sternly.

â€œI? What have I...?â€ stammered Pierre.

â€œSo it seems youâ€™re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about?
What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.â€

Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but
could not reply.

â€œIf you wonâ€™t answer, Iâ€™ll tell you...â€ HÃ©lÃ¨ne went on. â€œYou
believe everything yeathe. He knew that he must do something to put an end to this
suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.

â€œWe had better separate,â€ he muttered in a broken voice.

â€œSeparate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,â€ said
HÃ©lÃ¨ne. â€œSeparate! Thatâ€™s a thing to frighten me with!â€

Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.

â€œIâ€™ll kill you!â€ he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table
with a strength he had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The
old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz
came a letter from KutÃºzov informing the prince of the fate that had
befallen his son.

â€œYour son,â€ wrote KutÃºzov, â€œfell before my eyes, a standard in
his hand and at the head of a regimentâ€”he fell as a hero, worthy of
his father and his fatherland. To the great regret ofof sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father
could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.

â€œBad news! Heâ€™s not among the prisoners nor among the killed!
KutÃºzov writes...â€ and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to
drive the princess away by that scream... â€œKilled!â€

The princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but on
hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her
beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as isterious taking place within her.

â€œMary,â€ she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying
back, â€œgive me your hand.â€ She took her sister-in-lawâ€™s hand and
held it below her waist.

Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained
lifted in childlike happiness.

Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her
sister-in-lawâ€™s dress.

â€œThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know,w days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid
their grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope:
he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he
sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a
monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his
memory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed. He tried not
to change his former way of life, but his strength faihe little princessâ€™ face, an expression of childish fear of
inevitable pain showed itself.

â€œNo, itâ€™s only indigestion?... Say itâ€™s only indigestion, say so,
Mary! Say...â€ And the little princess began to cry capriciously like
a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary
BogdÃ¡novna.

â€œMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!â€ she heard as she left the room.

The midwife was already on her e and distress she found that her prayers
did not calm her excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old
nurse, PraskÃ³vya SÃ¡vishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the
old prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl
round her head.

â€œIâ€™ve come to sit with you a bit, MÃ¡sha,â€ said the nurse, â€œand
here Iâ€™ve brought the princeâ€™s wedding candles to light before his
saint, my angel,â€ she said with a sigh.

â€œOh, nurse, ery good!â€ said the prince closing the door behind him, and
TÃ­khon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.

After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing
the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed
face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the
shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he
had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continue), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask
curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft.
Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was
knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open
casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose
locks of gray hair.

â€œPrincess, my dear, thereâ€™s someone driving up the avenue!â€ she
said, holding the casement and not closinp the
stairs and embraced his sister.

â€œYou did not get my letter?â€ he asked, and not waiting for a
replyâ€”which he would not have received, for the princess was unable to
speakâ€”he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the
doctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post
station), and again embraced his sister.

â€œWhat a strange fate, MÃ¡sha darling!â€ And having taken off his
cloak and felt boots, he went to the little y waited and listened.

â€œGo, dear,â€ said Princess Mary.

Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next
to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands
and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came
through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to
open it. Someone was holding it shut.

â€œYou canâ€m something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed
in Mary BogdÃ¡novnaâ€™s trembling white hands.


Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his fatherâ€™s
room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to
the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise
round his sonâ€™s neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.


Three days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went
up the sted up by
the efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks
as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
Moscow. As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the
family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties. DÃ³lokhov
recovered, and RostÃ³v became very friendly with him during his
convalescence. DÃ³lokhov lay ill at his motherâ€™s who loved him
passionately and tenderly, and old Mary IvÃ¡novn
DÃ³lokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to RostÃ³v in a way no
one would have expected of him.

â€œI know people consider me a bad man!â€ he said. â€œLet them! I
donâ€™t care a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love,
I love so that I would give my life for them, and the others Iâ€™d
throttle if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother,
and two or three friendsâ€”you among themâ€”and as for the rest I only
care about them ineing those
impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own
happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful
bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
young girls ready for anything and full of hopeâ€”experienced the same
feeling; sharing with the young folk of the RostÃ³vsâ€™ household a
readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.

Among the young men introduced by RostÃ³v one of the ed.

DÃ³lokhov often dined at the RostÃ³vsâ€™, never missed a performance at
which they were present, and went to Iogelâ€™s balls for young people
which the RostÃ³vs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to SÃ³nya
and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
glances without coloring, but even the old countess and NatÃ¡sha blushed
when they saw his looks.

It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible
influence e present, including DÃ³lokhov and DenÃ­sov.

Never had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous
atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the RostÃ³vsâ€™ house as at
this holiday time. â€œSeize the moments of happiness, love and be loved!
That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one
thing we are interested in here,â€ said the spirit of the place.

Nicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without
visiting al
â€œThere is something up,â€ thought Nicholas, and he was further
confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that DÃ³lokhov left immediately
after dinner. He called NatÃ¡sha and asked her what was the matter.

â€œAnd I was looking for you,â€ said NatÃ¡sha running out to him. â€œI
told you, but you would not believe it,â€ she said triumphantly. â€œHe
has proposed to SÃ³nya!â€

Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with SÃ³nya of late, something
seemed to give waye his return that they had talked alone and about their love.

â€œSophie,â€ he began, timidly at first and then more and more
boldly, â€œif you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and
advantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend...â€

SÃ³nya interrupted him.

â€œI have already refused,â€ she said hurriedly.

â€œIf you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I...â€

SÃ³nya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frighte were married
and so further increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished
them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of
the good-natured Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according
to the rules of his art, as he collected the tickets from all his
visitors. There was the fact that only those came who wished to dance
and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are
wearing long dresses for the first time. Wl beauty!â€ said DenÃ­sov.

â€œWho?â€

â€œCountess NatÃ¡sha,â€ answered DenÃ­sov.

â€œAnd how she dances! What gwace!â€ he said again after a pause.

â€œWho are you talking about?â€

â€œAbout your sister,â€ ejaculated DenÃ­sov testily.

RostÃ³v smiled.

â€œMy dear count, you were one of my best pupilsâ€”you must dance,â€
said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. â€œLook how many charming young
ladiesâ€”â€ He turned with the same request to DenÃ­sov who 

When it came to NatÃ¡shaâ€™s turn to choose a partner, she rose and,
tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran
timidly to the corner where DenÃ­sov sat. She saw that everybody was
looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that DenÃ­sov was refusing
though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.

â€œPlease, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich,â€ NatÃ¡sha was saying, â€œdo come!â€

â€œOh no, let me off, Countess,â€ DenÃ­sov replied.

â€œNow then, VÃ¡skaas if
he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath,
and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected
steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her
chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, NatÃ¡sha
did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement,
smiling as if she did not recognize him.

â€œWhat does this mean?â€ she brought out.

Although Iogel did not afinish dealing, and then IlyÃºshka will come with his
chorus.â€

â€œI called once or twice at your house,â€ said RostÃ³v, reddening.

DÃ³lokhov made no reply.

â€œYou may punt,â€ he said.

RostÃ³v recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
with DÃ³lokhov. â€œNone but fools trust to luck in play,â€ DÃ³lokhov
had then said.

â€œOr are you afraid to play with me?â€ DÃ³lokhov now asked as if
guessing RostÃ³vâ€™s thought.

Beneath his smileed in the
reckoning.â€

One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.

â€œYes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I
ask you to put the money on your cards,â€ replied DÃ³lokhov. â€œDonâ€™t
stint yourself, weâ€™ll settle afterwards,â€ he added, turning to
RostÃ³v.

The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.

All RostÃ³vâ€™s cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored
up against him. He wrote â€œ800 rt only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the
necessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart he watched
DÃ³lokhovâ€™s hands and thought, â€œNow then, make haste and let me have
this card and Iâ€™ll take my cap and drive home to supper with DenÃ­sov,
NatÃ¡sha, and SÃ³nya, and will certainly never touch a card again.â€ At
that moment his home life, jokes with PÃ©tya, talks with SÃ³nya, duets
with NatÃ¡sha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable APTER XIV

An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested
in their own play.

The whole interest was concentrated on RostÃ³v. Instead of sixteen
hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,
which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely
supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already
exceeded twenty thousand rubles. DÃ³lokhov was no longer listening to
stories or telling them,is mind.

â€œHe knows of course what this loss means to me. He canâ€™t want my
ruin. Wasnâ€™t he my friend? Wasnâ€™t I fond of him? But itâ€™s not his
fault. Whatâ€™s he to do if he has such luck?... And itâ€™s not my fault
either,â€ he thought to himself, â€œI have done nothing wrong. Have I
killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible
misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to
this table with the thought of winna splendid card all ready,â€ as if it
were the fun of the game which interested him most.

â€œItâ€™s all up! Iâ€™m lost!â€ thought he. â€œNow a bullet through my
brainâ€”thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s left me!â€ And at the same time he said
in a cheerful voice:

â€œCome now, just this one more little card!â€

â€œAll right!â€ said DÃ³lokhov, having finished the addition. â€œAll
right! Twenty-one rubles,â€ he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one
by which the total expe it all, and felt that DÃ³lokhov knew that he could save him from
all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does
with a mouse.

â€œYour cousin...â€ DÃ³lokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted
him.

â€œMy cousin has nothing to do with this and itâ€™s not necessary to
mention her!â€ he exclaimed fiercely.

â€œThen when am I to have it?â€

â€œTomorrow,â€ replied RostÃ³v and left the room.





CHAPTER XV

To say â€œtomor my inmost soul on fire,
   What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?

He was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling
black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy NatÃ¡sha.

â€œSplendid! Excellent!â€ exclaimed NatÃ¡sha. â€œAnother verse,â€ she
said, without noticing Nicholas.

â€œEverythingâ€™s still the same with them,â€ thought Nicholas,
glancing into the drawing room, where he saw VÃ©ra and his mother with
the old lady.

â€œAh, and herhy do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? Thereâ€™s
nothing to be happy about!â€ thought he.

SÃ³nya struck the first chord of the prelude.

â€œMy God, Iâ€™m a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain
is the only thing left meâ€”not singing!â€ his thoughts ran on. â€œGo
away? But where to? Itâ€™s oneâ€”let them sing!â€

He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at DenÃ­sov and the
girls and avoiding their eyes.

â€œNikÃ³lenka, what iwhich
leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
you and make you weep.

NatÃ¡sha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,
mainly because DenÃ­sov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang
as a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish,
painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing
well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: â€œIt is not trained,
but it is a e it? How fortunate!â€ he thought.

Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest
in RostÃ³vâ€™s soul! And this something was apart from everything else
in the world and above everything in the world. â€œWhat were losses, and
DÃ³lokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob
and yet be happy....â€





CHAPTER XVI

It was long since RostÃ³v had felt such enjoyment from music as he
did that day. But no sooner hadt, spreading out his arms and sinking
helplessly on the sofa.

â€œIt canâ€™t be helped! It happens to everyone!â€ said the son, with
a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a
worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He
longed to kiss his fatherâ€™s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness,
but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to
everyone!

The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his d seriously.

â€œWell then, what do you want? Youâ€™re all in love nowadays. Well,
if you are in love, marry him!â€ said the countess, with a laugh of
annoyance. â€œGood luck to you!â€

â€œNo, Mamma, Iâ€™m not in love with him, I suppose Iâ€™m not in love
with him.â€

â€œWell then, tell him so.â€

â€œMamma, are you cross? Donâ€™t be cross, dear! Is it my fault?â€

â€œNo, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?â€
said the countess smilintant, they
heard the quick rustle of the countessâ€™ dress. She came up to them.

â€œVasÃ­li DmÃ­trich, I thank you for the honor,â€ she said, with an
embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to DenÃ­sovâ€”â€œbut my
daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my sonâ€™s friend, you
would have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not
have obliged me to give this refusal.â€

â€œCountess...â€ said DenÃ­sov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face.aking leave of any of
his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland.





BOOK FIVE: 1806 - 07





CHAPTER I

After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the
TorzhÃ³k post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster
would not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing,
he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big
feet in their overboots on the table, and beipped, so that the screw could not get in or out,
but went on turning uselessly in the same place.

The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency
have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted
to get more money from the traveler.

â€œIs this good or bad?â€ Pierre asked himself. â€œIt is good for me,
bad for another traveler, and for himself itâ€™h
eternity.â€ And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread,
and again it turned uselessly in the same place.

His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by
Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. â€œAnd why did she resist
her seducer when she loved him?â€ he thought. â€œGod could not have put
into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wifeâ€”as she
oon about the roads, the traveler had closed his
eyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of
them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
deathâ€™s head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as
it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant
was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,
evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown.
This ac his spectacles.

â€œI have heard of you, my dear sir,â€ continued the stranger, â€œand
of your misfortune.â€ He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to
sayâ€”â€œYes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what
happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.â€â€”â€œI regret it very
much, my dear sir.â€

Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent
forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.

â€œI have not referrd to you.â€

â€œI am afraid,â€ said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the
confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own
habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefsâ€”â€œI am afraid I am very far
from understandingâ€”how am I to put it?â€”I am afraid my way of looking
at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one
another.â€

â€œI know your outlook,â€ said the Mason, â€œand the view of life you
mention, and which yodear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You do
not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in
thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!â€
pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.

He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.

â€œIf He were not,â€ he said quietly, â€œyou and I would not be
speaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom
hast thou denied?â€ he suddenly asked ve in the master who made it. To know Him is
hard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to
attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but
in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His
greatness....â€

Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Masonâ€™s face with
shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with
his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the founded on reason alone, not on those
worldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into
which intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one.
The highest wisdom has but one scienceâ€”the science of the wholeâ€”the
science explaining the whole creation and manâ€™s place in it. To
receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew oneâ€™s inner
self, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to
perfect oneâ€™s self. n abyss of deceit and
misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not
know God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear
sir!â€

After these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again
leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre
looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved
his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, â€œYes, a vile,
idle, vicious life!â€erhaps I may...â€

Pierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.

The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.

â€œHelp comes from God alone,â€ he said, â€œbut such measure of help as
our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to
Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarskiâ€ (he took out his notebook
and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four).
â€œAllow me to give you a piece of advice. When you nd in the
possibility of active brotherly love among men, which Joseph AlexÃ©evich
had revealed to him. A week after his arrival, the young Polish count,
Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society, came
into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in
which DÃ³lokhovâ€™s second had called on him, and, having closed the
door behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the
room, addressed Pierre.

â€œI have com and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small
well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of
a servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange
attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said
something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small
wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen
before. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound
Phen he
would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively
virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met Joseph
AlexÃ©evich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took the bandage
off his eyes and glanced around him. The room was in black darkness,
only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went nearer
and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book.
The book was the Gospel, and the white thing wo do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not
seen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue,
enlightenment?â€

At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a
sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at
confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete
stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated
breath and beating heart he moved towarasked him what he was
saying. â€œI have been an atheist,â€ answered Pierre.

â€œYou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,
therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?â€ said the
Rhetor, after a momentâ€™s pause.

â€œYes, yes,â€ assented Pierre.

The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast,
and began to speak.

â€œNow I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,â€ he said,
â€œand if this aim coious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed,
imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three
objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind,
especially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the
Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential,
and the second aim, that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not
much interest him because at that moment he felt with deliot what the seventh
virtue was and could not recall it.

The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre
whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
all that would be required of him.

â€œI am ready for everything,â€ said Pierre.

â€œI must also inform you,â€ said the Rhetor, â€œthat our Order
delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means, which
may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seekerf his trousers
to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
trouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him
a slipper for his left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment,
doubt, and self-derision, which appeared on his face against his will,
Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his
brother Rhetor, and awaited his furtenly and timidly in one slippered
and one booted foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his
bare chest. He was conducted from that room along passages that turned
backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the
Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with
mallets, the doors opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still
blindfolded) questioned him as to who he was, when and where he was
born, and so on. Then he 
swords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from
him and he was at once blindfolded again.

â€œNow thou hast seen the lesser light,â€ uttered a voice. Then the
candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the
bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together: â€œSic
transit gloria mundi.â€

Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
and at the people in it. Round a long table se around, remembered all he had already gone
through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast
at his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling,
prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the
feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. When
he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather
apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel
and th a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and
so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of
the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit down.
The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very long, and
Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to
understand what was being read. He managed to follow only the last words
of the statutes and these remained in his mind.

â€œIn our temples we rect as the others.

The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had
returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had
become completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits
and way of life.





CHAPTER V

The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at
home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,
one side of which symbolized God, another moral thint so yourself. Let us write her
a letter at once, and sheâ€™ll come here and all will be explained, or
else, my dear boy, let me tell you itâ€™s quite likely youâ€™ll have to
suffer for it.â€

Prince VasÃ­li gave Pierre a significant look.

â€œI know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a
keen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to
HÃ©lÃ¨ne.â€

Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince VasÃ­li
did ne.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with you? Are you ill?â€

â€œGo!â€ the quivering voice repeated. And Prince VasÃ­li had to go
without receiving any explanation.

A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons,
and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his
estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons
and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.





CHAPTER VI

The due his forehead, remarked:

â€œA bit touchedâ€”I always said so.â€

â€œI said from the first,â€ declared Anna PÃ¡vlovna referring to
Pierre, â€œI said at the time and before anyone elseâ€ (she insisted
on her priority) â€œthat that senseless young man was spoiled by the
depraved ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody
was in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and
when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at oneeral other less noteworthy persons.

The novelty Anna PÃ¡vlovna was setting before her guests that evening
was BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, who had just arrived as a special messenger from
the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.

The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that
evening was this:

â€œWhatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to
countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyancery important mission to
Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had
become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had
been so pleased at OlmÃ¼tz and according to which an ensign might rank
incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was
needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or
perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can
grant rewards, and inuity of most brilliant successes would secure
them, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the
actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,â€ said the Danish chargÃ©
dâ€™affaires.

â€œThe doubt is flattering,â€ said â€œthe man of profound intellect,â€
with a subtle smile.

â€œWe must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of
Austria,â€ said Mortemart. â€œThe Emperor of Austria can never have
thought of such a thing, it is only t and seemed greatly interested in
the state of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to
him with her usual smile.

â€œYou absolutely must come and see me,â€ she said in a tone that
implied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was
absolutely necessary.

â€œOn Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.â€

BorÃ­s promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a
conversation with her, when Anna PÃ¡vlen trying all that
evening to get in) â€œI only wished to say that we are wrong to fight
pour le Roi de Prusse!â€

BorÃ­s smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical
or appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody
laughed.

â€œYour joke is too bad, itâ€™s witty but unjust,â€ said Anna
PÃ¡vlovna, shaking her little shriveled finger at him.

â€œWe are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles.
Oh, that wickelon,
BorÃ­s received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for
him to come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to
him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly
and in a whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: â€œCome to dinner
tomorrow... in the evening. You must come.... Come!â€

During that stay in Petersburg, BorÃ­s became an intimate in the
countessâ€™ house.





CHAPTER VIII

The war was flaming 
her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed
passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself
to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angelâ€”as she
called her nephewâ€”and playing with him.

Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the
tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument
brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
rary, taking no part in the war and
secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.

On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.
Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his fatherâ€™s
absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who
had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters
for Prince Andrew.

Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
letters to Princand.

â€œPerhaps weâ€™d really better not wake him,â€ he said hesitating.

â€œAs you please... really... I think so... but as you please,â€ said
Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion
had prevailed. She drew her brotherâ€™s attention to the maid who was
calling him in a whisper.

It was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy
who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household
doctor and expechanically he
began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote
in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:

Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful
newsâ€”if itâ€™s not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete
victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing,
and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a
Germanâ€”I congratulate him! I canâ€™t make out what the comhad too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all
else.





CHAPTER IX

BilÃ­bin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and
though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms,
he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and
self-derision genuinely Russian. BilÃ­bin wrote that the obligation of
diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince
Andrew a reliable correspondent tson at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the
King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All
this is absolutely true.

â€œIn short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude,
it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more,
in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have
everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely,
a commander in chief. As it was considered theating to our frontierâ€”which do today.â€™

â€œâ€˜From all my riding,â€™ he writes to the Emperor, â€˜I have got a
saddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents
my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the
command to the general next in seniority, Count BuxhÃ¶wden, having sent
him my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is
a lack of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only
o
to fight a battle â€˜on his own handâ€™ as the Germans say. He does so.
This is the battle of PultÃºsk, which is considered a great victory but
in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have
a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who
retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to
that it is we who lost the battle of PultÃºsk. In short, we retreat
after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg 
soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot!
The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting,
and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the
regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything
to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals
overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the marauders even
attack our headquarters, and the commander in chief  was
dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.

â€œAll is over,â€ he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his
forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it
empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the
curtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could not
find the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he
lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow,that
were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly
catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture
and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing
to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the
world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair
against the muslin of the curtain.

â€œYes, this is the one thing left me now,â€ he said with a sigh.





CHAPTEaffairs which was far from satisfactory.

Despite Count BezÃºkhovâ€™s enormous wealth, since he had come into an
income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year,
Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him
an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the
following budget:

About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about
30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the towmpossible, but suggested selling
the forests in the province of KostromÃ¡, the land lower down the river,
and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which
operations according to him were connected with such complicated
measuresâ€”the removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so
onâ€”that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:

â€œYes, yes, do so.â€

Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
to attendtates and see for himself how far his orders
had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had
entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.

The chief steward, who considered the young countâ€™s attempts almost
insaneâ€”unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfsâ€”made
some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs
as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large
buildingsâ€”schools, hospitals, and buildings erected or in course of erection,
all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon
to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewardsâ€™ accounts, according to
which the serfsâ€™ manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the
touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue
coats.

What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and him of how much more he might do
for these simple, kindly people.

The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
through the naÃ¯ve and intelligent count and played with him as with
a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,
pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.

Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that r faÃ§ade
still in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid
out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a
water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight,
the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of
tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply
to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly
built lodge close to the pond. AntÃ³n, a re his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
concentration on some one thought.

As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation,
it was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They
put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to
be talked over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on
some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans
for the future, Pieregan, but Prince Andrew interrupted
him.

â€œBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels
and all you have been doing on your estates.â€

Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far
as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been
made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierreâ€™s story of what he
had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened
not only without interesver, and forever.â€

â€œForever?â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œNothingâ€™s forever.â€

â€œBut you know how it all ended, donâ€™t you? You heard of the duel?â€

â€œAnd so you had to go through that too!â€

â€œOne thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,â€ said
Pierre.

â€œWhy so?â€ asked Prince Andrew. â€œTo kill a vicious dog is a very
good thing really.â€

â€œNo, to kill a man is badâ€”wrong.â€

â€œWhy is it wrong?â€ urged Prince Andrew. â€, and you do not really believe what you are
saying.â€ Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.

â€œWhen you see my sister, Princess Mary, youâ€™ll get on with her,â€
he said. â€œPerhaps you are right for yourself,â€ he added after
a short pause, â€œbut everyone lives in his own way. You lived for
yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness
when you began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I
lived for gred, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum
for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a
peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give
them rest and leisure?â€ said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. â€œAnd
I have done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done
something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good
action, and more than that, you canâ€™t make me believe that you douse I think and canâ€™t help thinking, just as
he canâ€™t help plowing and mowing; if he didnâ€™t, he would go to the
drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical
labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical
idleness, but would grow fat and die. The third thingâ€”what else was
it you talked about?â€ and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. â€œAh,
yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come anduch ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit
without moving, undertaking nothing....â€

â€œLife as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do
nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the
honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get
out of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary
qualifications for itâ€”the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness
necessary for the position. Thends.â€

â€œWell, there you see!â€

â€œYes, but it is not as you imagine,â€ Prince Andrew continued. â€œI
did not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk
who had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been
very glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my fatherâ€”that again
is for myself.â€

Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly
while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions therr agree with you,â€ said
Pierre.





CHAPTER XII

In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and
then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.

Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in
his husbandry.

Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and
apparently immersed in his own thoughts.

He was tht to live out
his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our
fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up
to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I
have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
which is hidden in heaven,â€ said Pierre.

Prince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to
Pierreâ€™s words. More than once, when the noise of the wheur life here as the end
of everything. On earth, here on this earthâ€ (Pierre pointed to
the fields), â€œthere is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the
universe, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who
are now the children of earth areâ€”eternallyâ€”children of the
whole universe. Donâ€™t I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast
harmonious whole? Donâ€™t I feel that I form one link, one step, between
the lower and higher beings, in thi
in....â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s it then! You know that there is a there and there is a
Someone? There is the future life. The Someone isâ€”God.â€

Prince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been
taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half
below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near
the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen,
coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on o the customary conditions
of his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to
develop existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in
Prince Andrewâ€™s life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the
same old way, inwardly he began a new life.





CHAPTER XIII

It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front
entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house,
Prince Andrew with a smiless Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face
when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon
stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monkâ€™s
cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an
armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on
her childlike face.

â€œAndrew, why didnâ€™t you warn me?â€ said the princess, with mild
reproach, as she stood before he me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young
     man.â€


â€œReally?â€ said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into
IvÃ¡nushkaâ€™s face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked
round at them all with crafty eyes.

Princess Maryâ€™s embarrassment on her peopleâ€™s account was quite
unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, loweringWhy are you not going to the right place? Go to KolyÃ¡zin where a
wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.â€™ On
hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went.â€

All were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones,
drawing in her breath.

â€œSo I come, master, and the people say to me: â€˜A great blessing has
been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother,
the Holy Virgin Mother of God.â€™sh you,â€ she said admonishingly, turning to
Pierre.

â€œHow did the star get into the icon?â€ Pierre asked.

â€œAnd was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?â€ said
Prince Andrew, with a smile.

PelagÃ©ya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.

â€œOh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!â€ she began,
her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. â€œMaster, what have you
said? God forgive you!â€ And she crossed herself. â€œLoreep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and
there was such peace all around, such blessedness, that one donâ€™t want
to come out, even into the light of heaven again.â€

Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out
of the room, and then, leaving â€œGodâ€™s folkâ€ to finish their tea,
Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.

â€œYou are very kind,â€ she said to him.

â€œOh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time
would come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it
chaffingly, but without getting angry.

â€œDrain the blood from menâ€™s veins and put in water instead, then
there will be no more war! Old womenâ€™s nonsenseâ€”old womenâ€™s
nonsense!â€ he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately
on the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew,
evidently not wi and let himself be taken
in his arms, and Michael IvÃ¡novich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at
him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.

The old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierreâ€™s
account. And during the two days of the young manâ€™s visit he was
extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.

When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they
began to express their opinions of him as people his own
place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of
all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right
place and took mistaken decisions; here was no SÃ³nya with whom he
ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of
going there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours
in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not
that innumerable crowd of people of whom nmed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the
regiment.

After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents
in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved
to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
parents.

Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at PultÃºsk
and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting
the Emperorâ€™s arrival and the bmen wounded in action, but had
lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals,
death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling
that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able
to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals.
When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
ground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called
â€œMÃ¡shkaâ€™s sweet or
to legends of AlÃ«sha the Sly, or the priestâ€™s laborer MikÃ³lka.

The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,
half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and,
in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as
before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was
no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles.
The general trend of the campaign was rarely spokway, DenÃ­sov, who did not himself know what
RostÃ³vâ€™s relations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid
him for his quickness of temper, and RostÃ³v replied:

â€œSay what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I canâ€™t tell
you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....â€

DenÃ­sov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
without looking at RostÃ³v, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.

â€œAh, what a mad bâ€™ campfire were placed on
a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the â€œreception roomâ€â€”as
DenÃ­sov called that part of the hutâ€”and it was then so warm that the
officers, of whom there were always some with DenÃ­sov and RostÃ³v, sat
in their shirt sleeves.

In April, RostÃ³v was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and
eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed
his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm,v.

Five minutes later, DenÃ­sov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots
on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took
his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to
RostÃ³vâ€™s inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly
that he had some business.

â€œLet God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!â€ said DenÃ­sov
going out, and RostÃ³v heard the hoofs of several horses splashing
through the mu are you pestewing me for?â€ cried DenÃ­sov, suddenly
losing his temper. â€œI shall answer for it and not you, and youâ€™d
better not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!â€ he shouted
at the officers.

â€œVery well, then!â€ shouted the little officer, undaunted and not
riding away. â€œIf you are determined to rob, Iâ€™ll...â€

â€œGo to the devil! quick maâ€™ch, while youâ€™re safe and sound!â€ and
DenÃ­sov turned his horse on the officer.

â€œVery wete such as RostÃ³v had never yet seen him in.
DenÃ­sov could not speak and gasped for breath. When RostÃ³v asked what
was the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a
hoarse, feeble voice.

Alarmed at DenÃ­sovâ€™s condition, RostÃ³v suggested that he should
undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.

â€œTwy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but
Iâ€™ll always thwash scoundwels... and Iâ€™ll tell the Empewoâ€™...
â€ cried DenÃ­sov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing
under his black mustache. â€œIâ€™d have killed him if they hadnâ€™t
taken him away!â€

â€œBut what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,â€ said RostÃ³v.
â€œYouâ€™ve set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up
again.â€

DenÃ­sov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and
cheerful.

But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into RostÃ³vâ€™s and
DenÃ­sovâ€™s dugouters of inquiry and notices
from the court arrived, and on the first of May, DenÃ­sov was ordered
to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
office. On the previous day PlÃ¡tov reconnoitered with two Cossack
regiments and two squadrons of hussars. DenÃ­sov, as was his wont, rode
out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet fired by
a French sharpshooter hit higar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.

â€œI canâ€™t tear myself to pieces,â€ the doctor was saying. â€œCome to
MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich in the evening. I shall be there.â€

The assistant asked some further questions.

â€œOh, do the best you can! Isnâ€™t it all the same?â€ The doctor
noticed RostÃ³v coming upstairs.

â€œWhat do you want, sir?â€ said the doctor. â€œWhat do you want?
The bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a
pesI fancy. However, Iâ€™ll look up our list. We had a list.
Have you got it, MakÃ©ev?â€

â€œMakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich has the list,â€ answered the assistant. â€œBut if
youâ€™ll step into the officersâ€™ wards youâ€™ll see for yourself,â€
he added, turning to RostÃ³v.

â€œAh, youâ€™d better not go, sir,â€ said the doctor, â€œor you may
have to stay here yourself.â€

But RostÃ³v bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant
to show him the way.

â€œOnly do
looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same
thing there. He stood still, looking silently around. He had not at all
expected such a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the
passage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge
by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs
outstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled back so that
only the whites were seen, and on his bare . He drew
nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the
other had been amputated above the knee. His neighbor on the other side,
who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back, was
a young soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled
and his eyes were rolled back. RostÃ³v looked at the young soldier and a
cold chill ran down his back.

â€œWhy, this one seems...â€ he began, turning to the assistant.

â€€ he added, when he heard
who RostÃ³v wanted. â€œHere, here,â€ and TÃºshin led him into the next
room, from whence came sounds of several laughing voices.

â€œHow can they laugh, or even live at all here?â€ thought RostÃ³v,
still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong
in the soldiersâ€™ ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those
envious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face
of that young soldier with eyes roe made to his enemies. His hospital companions,
who had gathered round RostÃ³vâ€”a fresh arrival from the world
outsideâ€”gradually began to disperse as soon as DenÃ­sov began reading
his answer. RostÃ³v noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had
already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the
man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed,
gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed TÃºshin still
lis Iâ€™m not going to gwovel?â€ DenÃ­sov interrupted
him, went on reading his paper.

RostÃ³v had not the courage to persuade DenÃ­sov, though he
instinctively felt that the way advised by TÃºshin and the other
officers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of
service to DenÃ­sov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty
temper.

When the reading of DenÃ­sovâ€™s virulent reply, which took more than an
hour, was over, RostÃ³v said nothing he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.

â€œYou are speaking of Buonaparte?â€ asked the general, smiling.

BorÃ­s looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
being tested.

â€œI am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,â€ he replied. The
general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.

â€œYou will go far,â€ he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.

BorÃ­s was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two
Empknown, but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted
him. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so
that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from
cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer,
would now have been surprised had he been absent.

BorÃ­s lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count ZhilÃ­nski.
ZhilÃ­nski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately
fond of the French, and almos lodging, dressed
in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point
of view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French
officer, who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of
hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly
seized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether
DrubetskÃ³y lived there. BorÃ­s, hearing a strange voice in the
anteroom, came out to meet him. An exly did not receive this new Russian person very
willingly into his circle and did not speak to RostÃ³v. BorÃ­s did not
appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same
pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which
he had met RostÃ³v, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the
Frenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen,
addressed the obstinately taciturn RostÃ³v, saying that the latter had
probably com³v as a general listens to the
report of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight into
RostÃ³vâ€™s eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened
RostÃ³v felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.

â€œI have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe
in such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the
Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general,
I think...â€

â€œSo you donâ€™t waFrench and their
uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French
Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and
preparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors
draped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In
the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.

â€œBorÃ­s doesnâ€™t want to help me and I donâ€™t want to ask him.
Thatâ€™s settled,â€ thought Nicholas. â€œAlch him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even
thank me. â€˜I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is
the greatest happiness,â€™â€ RostÃ³v fancied the sovereign saying. And
passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch
of the Emperorâ€™s house.

A broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he
saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the
lower floor.

â€œWhom do you rom? Who are you?â€

â€œI come from Major DenÃ­sov,â€ answered RostÃ³v.

â€œAre you an officer?â€

â€œLieutenant Count RostÃ³v.â€

â€œWhat audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with
you... go,â€ and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed
him.

RostÃ³v went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were
many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.

Cursing his temerity, his heart sinkis. Forgetting the danger of being recognized,
RostÃ³v went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive
civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored:
that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and
mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign
rose again in RostÃ³vâ€™s soul in all its old force. In the uniform of
the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regimentâ€”white chamois-leather breeches and high
bootsâ€”anther group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and
at the head of them RostÃ³v recognized Napoleon. It could be no one
else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over
a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding
a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered
saddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did
so, RostÃ³v, with his cavalrymanâ€™s eye, could not he added
Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance
exasperating to RostÃ³v, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn
up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
Emperor.

â€œWill Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?â€ said Alexander
and took a few hasty steps toward Prince KozlÃ³vski, the commander of
the battalion.

Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,
tore it in doihis eyes and persistently gazed at his
own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what
he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white
hand holding the Order touched one of LÃ¡zarevâ€™s buttons. It was as if
Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch
that soldierâ€™s breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded,
and distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid
thecap, lads!â€ shouted a PreobrazhÃ©nsk soldier, donning a
shaggy French cap.

â€œItâ€™s a fine thing! First-rate!â€

â€œHave you heard the password?â€ asked one Guardsâ€™ officer of
another. â€œThe day before yesterday it was â€˜NapolÃ©on, France,
bravoureâ€™; yesterday, â€˜Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.â€™ One day our
Emperor gives it and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send
a St. Georgeâ€™s Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be
done. before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.
There he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself,
had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a
dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation
naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of
the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longbe left! That way we shall be saying there is no Godâ€”nothing!â€
shouted Nicholas, banging the tableâ€”very little to the point as it
seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own
thoughts.

â€œOur business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! Thatâ€™s
all....â€ said he.

â€œAnd to drink,â€ said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.

â€œYes, and to drink,â€ assented Nicholas. â€œHullo there! Another
bottle!â€ he shoute€”were carried
out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty.

He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked,
and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.

On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
free agricultural laborersâ€”this being one of the first examples of
the kind in Russia. On other estates the serfsâ€™ compulsory labor was
commuted for a quitrent. A trained mde.

They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before.
They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green
fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge,
uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of
stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a
birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the forest it was
almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birchesnful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the
dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak,
refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
the sunshine.

â€œSpring, love, happiness!â€ this oak seemed to say. â€œAre you not
weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the
same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look
at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and alonged to
bathe.

Prince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which
he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds
of the RostÃ³vsâ€™ house at OtrÃ¡dnoe. He heard merry girlish cries
behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross
the path of his calÃ¨che. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a
dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with
a white handkerchief on herroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He
read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the
room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the
stupid old man (as he called RostÃ³v), who had made him stay by assuring
him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he
was vexed with himself for having stayed.

He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the
shutters the moonlight, as is. Prince
Andrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional
presence.

â€œSÃ³nya! SÃ³nya!â€ he again heard the first speaker. â€œOh, how can
you sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up,
SÃ³nya!â€ she said almost with tears in her voice. â€œThere never,
never was such a lovely night before!â€

SÃ³nya made some reluctant reply.

â€œDo just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come here....
Darling, sweetheart, le an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded
yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was
thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest
did not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood
around, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.

The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only
a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the roay decided
finally and decisively. â€œIt is not enough for me to know what I have
in meâ€”everyone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to
fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be
lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it, but so that
it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!â€


On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn
and found all sorts of reasorince Andrew, crossing his
arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as
he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a
crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with
fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and womanâ€™s beauty
and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was
particularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.

â€œMy dear,â€ Princess Mary entering atse vague liberal dreams with which the
Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he had tried to put
into effect with the aid of his associates, CzartorÃ½ski, NovosÃ­ltsev,
KochubÃ©y, and StrÃ³gonovâ€”whom he himself in jest had called his
ComitÃ© de salut publicâ€”were taking shape and being realized.

Now all these men were replaced by SperÃ¡nski on the civil side, and
ArakchÃ©ev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a
gentleman of theout his personal qualities: he has been commissioned to
consider my project, so he alone can get it adopted,â€ thought Prince
Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people
in Count ArakchÃ©evâ€™s waiting room.

During his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the
anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms
were well known to him. Count ArakchÃ©evâ€™s anteroom had quite a
special character. The face conducted to the door and the officer on
duty said in a whisper, â€œTo the right, at the window.â€

Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of
forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles,
scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red
nose. ArakchÃ©ev turned his head toward him without looking at him.

â€œWhat is your petition?â€ asked ArakchÃ©ev.

â€œI am not petitioning, your excellency,â€ns, and I have recommended that
your honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.â€

Prince Andrew smiled.

â€œI donâ€™t want one.â€

â€œA member without salary,â€ repeated ArakchÃ©ev. â€œI have the
honor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?â€ he shouted, bowing
to Prince Andrew.





CHAPTER V

While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee
Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly those urned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the
reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine
society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a
good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account
of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this
the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had
greatly improved during these last five years, having softenee land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but
difficult to rule.... Just the same as nowâ€”I ask you, Countâ€”who will
be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?â€

â€œThose who pass the examinations, I suppose,â€ replied KochubÃ©y,
crossing his legs and glancing round.

â€œWell, I have PryÃ¡nichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a
priceless man, but heâ€™s sixty. Is he to go up for examination?â€

â€œYes, thatâ€™s a diNapoleon.

SperÃ¡nski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people
involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to
speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and
he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.

Prince Andrew followed SperÃ¡nskiâ€™s every word and movement with
particular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men
who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeti
white handsâ€”the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the
extraordinarily disdainful composure with which SperÃ¡nski answered
the old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from
an immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud,
SperÃ¡nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or
disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.

Having talked for a little while in the general circle, SperÃ¡nski rose
and coming up to Prontradict. Though he usually spoke easily
and well, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking
with SperÃ¡nski. He was too much absorbed in observing the famous
manâ€™s personality.

â€œGrounds of personal ambition maybe,â€ SperÃ¡nski put in quietly.

â€œAnd of state interest to some extent,â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ asked SperÃ¡nski quietly, lowering his eyes.

â€œI am an admirer of Montesquieu,â€ replied Prince Andrew, â€
have attained the same end,â€ returned Prince Andrew. â€œEvery courtier
considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.â€

â€œYet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,â€
said SperÃ¡nski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably
an argument which was embarrassing for his companion. â€œIf you will
do me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday,â€ he added, â€œI will,
after talking with MagnÃ­tski, let you know what may io find in someone the living ideal of that
perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in
SperÃ¡nski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous
man. Had SperÃ¡nski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed
the same breeding and traditions, BolkÃ³nski would soon have discovered
his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, SperÃ¡nskiâ€™s strange
and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because
he rational, and
was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything
seemed so simple and clear in SperÃ¡nskiâ€™s exposition that Prince
Andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and
argued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and
not submit to SperÃ¡nskiâ€™s opinions entirely. Everything was right
and everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince
Andrew. This was SperÃ¡nskiâ€™s co never
felt the doubt, â€œIs not all I think and believe nonsense?â€ And
it was just this peculiarity of SperÃ¡nskiâ€™s mind that particularly
attracted Prince Andrew.

During the first period of their acquaintance BolkÃ³nski felt a
passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for
Bonaparte. The fact that SperÃ¡nski was the son of a village priest,
and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his
humble origin (as in fact manetersburg
after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading
position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral
lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various
lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection
of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms,
in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular.
He supported almost singlehanded the uniforms and decorations at which they
aimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up
twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a
dozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre
remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote
all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to
dwell arose in his soul.

He divided the Brothers he knew into four categorifluential through their connections or rank,
and of whom there were very many in the lodge.

Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry,
at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely
on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but
suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated
from its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went
abroad to be initiated into the hit men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and
folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity
of purpose and possessed of authority and power.

â€œTo attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice
and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world,
receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we
are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What but now we need much more powerful methods. It is
now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue
a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the
passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is
therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions
within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means to that end.

â€œAs soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every stateaccepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the
usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.





CHAPTER VIII

Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For three
days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at
home receiving no one and going nowhere.

It was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored
him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she
wifference
whether he lived with his wife or not?

Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late
one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph
AlexÃ©evich. This is what he noted in his diary:

Moscow, 17th November

I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I
have experienced. Joseph AlexÃ©evich is living poorly and has for three
years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. Noare unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of
the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is
attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground
Joseph AlexÃ©evich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the
depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said
to me, â€œthe chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in
perfeown all my actions.

Petersburg, 23rd November

I am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears and
said that HÃ©lÃ¨ne was here and that she implored me to hear her; that
she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew
that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on
refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and
advice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would have told me whae Emperors
and had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic
notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself
had noticed her in the theater and said of her: â€œCâ€™est un superbe
animal.â€ * Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not
surprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer than before. What did
surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded
in gaining the reputation â€œdâ€™ une femmwas just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He was
that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no oneâ€™s
way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the
drawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an
advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during
the last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract
interests and his sincere contempt for all else, had d him
that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition, first
by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself
to suspect.

â€œNo, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced
her former infatuations,â€ he told himself. â€œThere has never been
an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the
heartâ€â€”a statement which, though gathered from an unknown source,
he believed implicitly. Yet st
walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation,
(2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw
from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family
duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.


27th November

I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,
help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures,
but without proper feeli me several
times whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I
could not reply) and that according to my observation he is incapable of
feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied
with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to
doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all the time I stood
alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling
contemptuously at my words, and I wily Spirit, Him!...


3rd December

Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went and
paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my
imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when DÃ³lokhov,
meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying
perfect peace of mind in spite of my wifeâ€™s absence. At the time I
gave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in
my mind gave himt, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a
fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I
dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on
the other. I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and
pointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and in the garden was a large
and beautiful building. I woke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature,
help me to tear from myself these dogsâ€”my passions especially at is your chief temptation? Do
you know it? I think you know it already.â€ Abashed by this question,
I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head
incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living
with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To
this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of oneâ€™s embraces
and gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that
I should be ashamed to d soul with its
beloved. And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden
in transparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up to the
clouds. And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a
representation of the Song of Songs. And looking at those drawings I
dreamed I felt that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away
from them. Lord, help me! My God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy
will be done; but if I am myself the their
district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the
men who very soon became frequent visitors at the RostÃ³vsâ€™ house in
Petersburg were BorÃ­s, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and
dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the RostÃ³vsâ€™
and paid the eldest daughter, Countess VÃ©ra, the attentions a young man
pays when he intends to propose.

Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
Austerlitze my wife.â€


Bergâ€™s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure
Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess RostÃ³va; but
Bergâ€™s chief characteristic was such a naÃ¯ve and good natured egotism
that the RostÃ³vs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing,
since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed
excellent. Moreover, the Rostchanged his
mind and said â€œto take tea with us,â€ and quickly doubling up his
tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying
his dream of happiness.

After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Bergâ€™s
proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took
possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere.
In the familyâ€™s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness
and constraint
it.... I like it. You shall be satisfied....â€

And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the
conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not
know for certain how much VÃ©ra would have and did not receive at least
part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.

â€œBecause, consider, Countâ€”if I allowed myself to marry now
without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting
badly....â€t he did not wish to see her, and
this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
of him.

â€œNowadays old friends are not remembered,â€ the countess would say
when BorÃ­s was mentioned.

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed
to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously
and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
which he had entered. When the RostÃ³vs came toed NatÃ¡shaâ€™s laughing eyes.

â€œAnd is Papa older?â€ she asked.

NatÃ¡sha sat down and, without joining in BorÃ­sâ€™ conversation with
the countess, silently and minutely studied her childhoodâ€™s suitor. He
felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced
at her occasionally.

BorÃ­sâ€™ uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all
comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This NatÃ¡sha noticed at once.
He sat rather sidewan explanation with
NatÃ¡sha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten, that in
spite of everything... she could not be his wife, that he had no means,
and they would never let her marry him. But he failed to do so and felt
awkward about entering on such an explanation. From day to day he
became more and more entangled. It seemed to her mother and SÃ³nya that
NatÃ¡sha was in love with BorÃ­s as of old. She sang him his favorite
songs, showed him her album, makibelow. NatÃ¡sha jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled
over to the wall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled
down, raising her knees to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost
inaudibly, now covering herself up head and all, and now peeping at her
mother. The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
stern face, but seeing, that NatÃ¡shaâ€™s head was covered, she smiled
in her kind, weak way.

â€œNow then, now then!â€ said s steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess
only saw her daughterâ€™s face in profile. That face struck her by its
peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.

NatÃ¡sha was listening and considering.

â€œWell, what then?â€ said she.

â€œYou have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You
know you canâ€™t marry him.â€

â€œWhy not?â€ said NatÃ¡sha, without changinga, Iâ€™ll
have a talk with BorÃ­s. He need not come so often....â€

â€œWhy not, if he likes to?â€

â€œBecause I know it will end in nothing....â€

â€œHow can you know? No, Mamma, donâ€™t speak to him! What nonsense!â€
said NatÃ¡sha in the tone of one being deprived of her property.
â€œWell, I wonâ€™t marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy
it.â€ NatÃ¡sha smiled and looked at her mother. â€œNot to marry, but
just so,â€ she added.

â€œHow so, my pt thinking that no one
could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.

â€œSÃ³nya?â€ she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little
kitten with her enormous plait of hair. â€œNo, how could she? Sheâ€™s
virtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know
anything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how
clever I am and how... charming she is,â€ she went on, speaking
of herself in the third person, and imagid fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried
footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the carriages emerged men
wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine
cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them
with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize
at the entrance.

Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the
crowd and caps were doffed.

â€œThe Emperor?... No, a minister.e over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and
their hair dressed Ã  la grecque.

Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and
ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork
silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the
hairdressing was almost done. SÃ³nya was finishing dressing and so was
the countess, but NatÃ¡sha, who had bustled about helping them all, was
behindhand. She was still sitti
hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning
up the hem of her skirt.

The cause of the delay was NatÃ¡shaâ€™s skirt, which was too long.
Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
countess and SÃ³nya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment
up high on one uplifted hand.

â€œMÃ¡vra, quicker, darling!â€

â€œGive me my thimble, Mig lady.

â€œWell, if itâ€™s too long weâ€™ll tack it up... weâ€™ll tack it up
in one minute,â€ said the resolute DunyÃ¡sha taking a needle that was
stuck on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor,
set to work once more.

At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in her cap
and velvet gown.

â€œOo-oo, my beauty!â€ exclaimed the count, â€œshe looks better than
any of you!â€

He would have embraced her but, blushing, shet once
had time to think of what lay before her.

In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she
for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
the ball, in those brightly lighted roomsâ€”with music, flowers, dances,
the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The
prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true,
so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of th same words to the various arrivals,
â€œCharmÃ© de vous voir,â€ * greeted the RostÃ³vs and PerÃ³nskaya in
the same manner.

    * â€œDelighted to see you.â€


The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her
black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostessâ€™ eye
involuntarily rested longer on the slim NatÃ¡sha. She looked at her
and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as
hostess. Looking at her she may have recall millionairess,â€ said PerÃ³nskaya. â€œAnd
look, here come her suitors.â€

â€œThat is BezÃºkhovaâ€™s brother, Anatole KurÃ¡gin,â€ she said,
indicating a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them
with head erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies.
â€œHeâ€™s handsome, isnâ€™t he? I hear they will marry him to that rich
girl. But your cousin, DrubetskÃ³y, is also very attentive to her. They
say she has millions. Oh yes, thatâ€™s the Frencut Prince Andrew. â€œYou remember, he stayed a
night with us at OtrÃ¡dnoe.â€

â€œOh, you know him?â€ said PerÃ³nskaya. â€œI canâ€™t bear him. Il fait
Ã  prÃ©sent la pluie et le beau temps. * Heâ€™s too proud for anything.
Takes after his father. And heâ€™s hand in glove with SperÃ¡nski,
writing some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies!
Thereâ€™s one talking to him and he has turned away,â€ she said,
pointing at him. â€œIâ€™d give it to him if he tr, and various generals, whom PerÃ³nskaya
diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners
and were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the
polonaise. NatÃ¡sha felt that she would be left with her mother and
SÃ³nya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not having
been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms hanging down,
her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, and with
bated breath and glitteriating to NatÃ¡shaâ€”as if there were
nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not
listen to or look at VÃ©ra, who was telling her something about her own
green dress.

At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced
with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the
RostÃ³vs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they
were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the
diumors
were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was
gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle.

Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperorâ€™s
presence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to
dance.

Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.

â€œYou always dance. I have a protÃ©gÃ©e, the young RostÃ³va, here. Ask
her,â€ he ing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently
of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender
bare arms and neck were not beautifulâ€”compared to HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€™s her
shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But HÃ©lÃ¨ne seemed, as
it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had
scanned her person, while NatÃ¡sha was like a girl exposed for the first
time, who would have felt very much ashamed had she not only noticed that he had gone
because the ball became livelier after his departure. For one of the
merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner. He
reminded her of their first encounter in the OtrÃ¡dnoe avenue, and how
she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he
had involuntarily overheard her. NatÃ¡sha blushed at that recollection
and tried to excuse herself, as if there had been something to be
ashamed of in what Princa month before she will be married....
Such as she are rare here,â€ he thought, as NatÃ¡sha, readjusting a
rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.

When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked
his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. NatÃ¡sha did not answer
at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: â€œHow
can you ask su mind did not dwell
on it long. â€œYes, it was a very brilliant ball,â€ and then... â€œYes,
that little RostÃ³va is very charming. Thereâ€™s something fresh,
original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.â€ That
was all he thought about yesterdayâ€™s ball, and after his morning tea
he set to work.

But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work
and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work, as he
often did, and d
taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He
listened with quiet irony to BÃ­tskiâ€™s enthusiastic account of it. A
very simple thought occurred to him: â€œWhat does it matter to me or to
BÃ­tski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that
make me any happier or better?â€

And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince
Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that
eveningbreast, and evidently still
the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His
guests surrounded him. MagnÃ­tski, addressing himself to SperÃ¡nski,
was relating an anecdote, and SperÃ¡nski was laughing in advance at
what MagnÃ­tski was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room
MagnÃ­tskiâ€™s words were again crowned by laughter. StolÃ½pin gave
a deep bass guffaw as he muf an official revision, remarkable for the
stupidity of everybody concerned. StolÃ½pin, stuttering, broke into
the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
under the former order of thingsâ€”threatening to give a serious turn
to the conversation. MagnÃ­tski starting quizzing StolÃ½pin about his
vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its
former lively tone.

Evidently SperÃ¡nski liked to rest after his labors and 
story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few
moments all were silent.

Having sat some time at table, SperÃ¡nski corked a bottle of wine and,
remarking, â€œNowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,â€ passed
it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly
went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed
to SperÃ¡nski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left
the room the generalmperor. He thought
of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered
how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and
procedure was discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and
promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded. He
recalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had
translated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian,
and he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vivid strikingly
poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!â€

In NatÃ¡sha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,
that in the OtrÃ¡dnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night
had already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no
longer and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it
found in it a new enjoyment.

After dinner NatÃ¡sha, at Prodâ€™s own fresh air. It did not
enter his head that he was in love with NatÃ¡sha; he was not thinking
about her, but only picturing her to himself, and in consequence all
life appeared in a new light. â€œWhy do I strive, why do I toil in this
narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open
to me?â€ said he to himself. And for the first time for a very long
while he began making happy plans for the future. He decided that he
must attend to his sty of such people as the
Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation.
Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small
but select company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though
he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared
to run into some expense for the sake of good societyâ€”that Pierre
could not refuse, and promised to come.

â€œBut donâ€™t be late, Count, if I may venture tohis dear wife of his was after all but a weak
woman who could not understand all that constitutes a manâ€™s dignity,
what it was ein Mann zu sein. * VÃ©ra at the same time smiling with a
sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the
same understood life wrongly, as according to VÃ©ra all men did. Berg,
judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. VÃ©ra, judging
only by her husband and generalizing from that observation, supposed
tha
Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully
undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle
the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
chair for himself, and Berg and VÃ©ra immediately began their evening
party, interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
guest.

VÃ©ra, having decided in her own mind that Pierrl authority superintended the setting out of
the table for boston. The general sat down by Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, who
was next to himself the most important guest. The old people sat with
the old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea table, on
which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
the Panins had at their party. Everything was just as it was everywhere
else.





CHAPTER XXI

Pierre, as one of the principal guests, haimes during the game, sitting now with
his back to NatÃ¡sha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six
rubbers he watched her and his friend.

â€œSomething very important is happening between them,â€ thought
Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and
made him neglect the game.

After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing
like that, and Pierre was released. NatÃ¡sha on one side was talking
with SÃ³nyatractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be,â€
he added, and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.

â€œYes, that is true, Prince. In our days,â€ continued
VÃ©raâ€”mentioning â€œour daysâ€ as people of limited intelligence are
fond of doing, imagining that they have discovered and appraised the
peculiarities of â€œour daysâ€ and that human characteristics change
with the timesâ€”â€œin our days a girl has so much freedom that the
pleasure ing his friendâ€™s strange animation with
surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on NatÃ¡sha as he rose.

â€œI must... I must have a talk with you,â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œYou
know that pair of womenâ€™s gloves?â€ (He referred to the Masonic
gloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he
loved.) â€œI... but no, I will talk to you later on,â€ and with a
strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince
Andrew approached  some
artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way.
SÃ³nya was afraid to leave NatÃ¡sha and afraid of being in the way when
she was with them. NatÃ¡sha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when
she remained alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by
his timidity. She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
not bring himself to do so.

In the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to
NatÃ¡sha anhile we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that
ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this!
Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.â€

â€œWhat else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...â€
said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew
had written in NatÃ¡shaâ€™s album.

â€œMamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?â€

â€œDonâ€™t, NatÃ¡sha! Pray to Geternity; again the question: for what?
presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic
labors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward
midnight, after he had left the countessâ€™ apartments, he was sitting
upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction
of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
with tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.

â€œAh, l not be a happier man than you.â€

â€œBut what of her?â€

â€œShe loves you.â€

â€œDonâ€™t talk rubbish...â€ said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking
into Pierreâ€™s eyes.

â€œShe does, I know,â€ Pierre cried fiercely.

â€œBut do listen,â€ returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the
arm. â€œDo you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to
someone.â€

â€œWell, go on, go on. I am very glad,â€ said Pierre, and his face
really changed, his brow becm, the gloomier seemed his own.





CHAPTER XXIII

Prince Andrew needed his fatherâ€™s consent to his marriage, and to
obtain this he started for the country next day.

His father received his sonâ€™s communication with external composure,
but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to
alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life
was already ending. â€œIf only they would let me end my days as I want
to,â€ thought theall
day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same.
Pierre did not come either and NatÃ¡sha, not knowing that Prince Andrew
had gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.

Three weeks passed in this way. NatÃ¡sha had no desire to go out
anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and
listless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the
evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable., filling the
whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt
cheerful. â€œWhatâ€™s the good of making so much of it? Things are nice
as it is,â€ she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the
room, not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with
each step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair
of shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of
the toe as gladly as she had to the brightened. He kissed the countessâ€™ hand and NatÃ¡shaâ€™s, and sat
down beside the sofa.

â€œIt is long since we had the pleasure...â€ began the countess,
but Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,
obviously in haste to say what he had to.

â€œI have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my
fatherâ€™s. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only
got back last night,â€ he said glancing at NatÃ¡sha; â€œId. She wished to love him as a
son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. â€œI
am sure my husband will consent,â€ said the countess, â€œbut your
father...â€

â€œMy father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express
condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
year. And I wished to tell you of that,â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œIt is true that NatÃ¡sha is still young, butâ€”so long as that?...â€

â€œIt is unaas if in vexation. Then she sighed
loudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.

â€œWhat is it? Whatâ€™s the matter?â€

â€œOh, I am so happy!â€ she replied, smiled through her tears, bent
over closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether
she might, and then kissed him.

Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find
in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly
changed; there
remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should
you come to love...â€ said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.

â€œWhy do you say that?â€ NatÃ¡sha interrupted him. â€œYou know that
from the very day you first came to OtrÃ¡dnoe I have loved you,â€ she
cried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.

â€œIn a year you will learn to know yourself....â€

â€œA whole year!â€ NatÃ¡sha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that
the marriage day to the
RostÃ³vsâ€™, but did not behave to NatÃ¡sha as an affianced lover: he
did not use the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her
hand. After their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural
relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each
other till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other
when as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves
now quite different beings: then they werew was afraid and ashamed to
speak of it. NatÃ¡sha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she
constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince
Andrew blushed, as he often did nowâ€”NatÃ¡sha particularly liked it in
himâ€”and said that his son would not live with them.

â€œWhy not?â€ asked NatÃ¡sha in a frightened tone.

â€œI cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...â€

â€œHow I should have loved him!â€ said NatÃ¡sha,eemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the
countess, and NatÃ¡sha sat down beside a little chess table with SÃ³nya,
thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.

â€œYou have known BezÃºkhov a long time?â€ he asked. â€œDo you like
him?â€

â€œYes, heâ€™s a dear, but very absurd.â€

And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his
absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.

â€œDo you know I hsuddenly and became
her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a
child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face.





CHAPTER XXV

During that year after his sonâ€™s departure, Prince Nicholas
BolkÃ³nskiâ€™s health and temper became much worse. He grew still more
irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his
frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out
her tender spots time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said
nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with
his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his
departure they were dissatisfied with one another.

Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend
Julie KarÃ¡gina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream)
of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for hehink, she was too angelically
innocent to have the strength to perform all a motherâ€™s duties. As a
young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so
as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince
Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will
there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of
her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
influence on me and on this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of
his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to
Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way
of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might
derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the
disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will
be decided very shortly.

Our family life goes on in the old way exceas I know, that girl is not the kind of girl who could please Prince
Andrew. I do not think he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do
not wish it. But I am running on too long and am at the end of my second
sheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty
care. My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.

MARY





CHAPTER XXVI

In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter
from Prince Andrewow he looks at the whole matter and whether
there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months.â€

After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the
letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:

â€œWrite and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It wonâ€™t be
longâ€”I shall soon set him free.â€

The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak
and, raising his voice more andveryone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest
depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief
consolation of her life. This comforting dream and hope were given her
by Godâ€™s folkâ€”the half-witted and other pilgrims who visited
her without the princeâ€™s knowledge. The longer she lived, the more
experience and observation she had of life, the greater was her wonder
at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happho for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn
heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in
a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of
her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of
life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to
become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary
thought about this for a long time, and at last made up he nor
sighing...â€ thought Princess Mary.

But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko
(Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she
was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.





BOOK SEVEN: 1810 - 11





CHAPTER I

The Bible legend tells us that the absence of laborâ€”idlenessâ€”was a
condition of the first manâ€™s blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man
has retained a love of idlen which, protected from all the
entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that
sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with
its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts
with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with
SÃ³nyaâ€™s love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully difficult
and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters
in French, beginnin going from bad to worse. â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, I
implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole
family wretched,â€ wrote the countess.

This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a
matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.

The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate
to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his
after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an eofficers tossed, embraced, and dropped RostÃ³v; the
soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted â€œhurrah!â€
and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first
post station.

During the first half of the journeyâ€”from KremenchÃºg to Kievâ€”all
RostÃ³vâ€™s thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with
the squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget
his three roans and DozhoyvÃ©yko, his quartermwhenever he looked at
her.

â€œYouâ€™re not the same at all,â€ he said.

â€œHow? Am I uglier?â€

â€œOn the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!â€ he whispered to
her.

â€œYes, yes, yes!â€ cried NatÃ¡sha, joyfully.

She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to
OtrÃ¡dnoe and showed him his last letter.

â€œWell, are you glad?â€ NatÃ¡sha asked. â€œI am so tranquil and happy
now.â€

â€œVery glad,â€ answered Nicholas. â€œHe is abts about this marriage.

â€œYou see he writes,â€ said she, showing her son a letter of Prince
Andrewâ€™s, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a
daughterâ€™s future married happiness, â€œhe writes that he wonâ€™t come
before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health
is very delicate. Donâ€™t tell NatÃ¡sha. And donâ€™t attach importance
to her being so bright: thatâ€™s because sheâ€™s living through the last
days of her girl and knee to his behind with great agility
at convenient moments between the words, shouting, â€œBe off! Never let
me see your face here again, you villain!â€

MÃ­tenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits
at OtrÃ¡dnoe. MÃ­tenka himself, returning tipsy from the town, used
to hide there, and many of the residents at OtrÃ¡dnoe, hiding from
MÃ­tenka, knew of its protective qualithow to remedy it). â€œNo, I beg you to attend to the
business. I am old. I...â€

â€œNo, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I
understand it all less than you do.â€

â€œDevil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings
forward from page to page,â€ he thought. â€œI used to understand what
a â€˜cornerâ€™ and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to
another page I donâ€™t understand at all,â€ said he to himself, and
after ths of that ardent young
sportsman RostÃ³v had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were
so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them
a three daysâ€™ rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on
a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an
undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.

All that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was
sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it bedence
and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his
Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This scorn
was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel,
disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all
the same his serf and huntsman.

â€œDaniel!â€ Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the
weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away
by that irresistible hing in the masterâ€™s apartment, and he hastened to say
all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling, out into
the open under the sky once more.

Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that
the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nicholas
ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was about to
go NatÃ¡sha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or
finished dressing and with her old nvery good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out
with the others.

In an hourâ€™s time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas,
with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
attending to trifles, went past NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya who were trying to
tell him something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent
a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his
chestnut DonÃ©ts, and whistling twith a large gray mustache.

â€œGood morning, Uncle!â€ said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.

â€œThatâ€™s it. Come on!... I was sure of it,â€ began â€œUncle.â€ (He
was a distant relative of the RostÃ³vsâ€™, a man of small means, and
their neighbor.) â€œI knew you wouldnâ€™t be able to resist it and
itâ€™s a good thing youâ€™re going. Thatâ€™s it! Come on!â€ (This was
â€œUncleâ€™sâ€ favorite expression.) â€œTake the covert at once, for my
GÃ­rchik says the Igo to our places and wonâ€™t budge.â€

â€œA good thing too, little countess,â€ said â€œUncle,â€ â€œonly mind
you donâ€™t fall off your horse,â€ he added, â€œbecauseâ€”thatâ€™s it,
come on!â€”youâ€™ve nothing to hold on to.â€

The oasis of the OtrÃ¡dnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off,
the huntsmen were already nearing it. RostÃ³v, having finally settled
with â€œUncleâ€ where they should set on the hounds, and having shown
NatÃ¡sha where she was to nds, who had, however, grown fat like their master
and his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred paces
farther along the edge of the wood stood MÃ­tka, the countâ€™s other
groom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the hunt, by
old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken
a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.

He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes westands the matter so well
that Daniel and I are often quite astounded,â€ said Simon, well knowing
what would please his master.

â€œRides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?â€

â€œA perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
ZavÃ¡rzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight
when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles
and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search farwo packs: the
sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in
the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and
it was with this that Danielâ€™s voice was heard calling ulyulyu.
The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were
becoming more distant.

Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had
entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand,
opened it and took d across
the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel
bushes parted behind the hounds and Danielâ€™s chestnut horse appeared,
dark with sweat. On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless,
his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.

â€œUlyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...â€ he cried. When he caught sight of the
count his eyes flashed lightning.

â€œBlast you!â€ he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the
cogreat excitement
arising from trivial causes. â€œWhat would it be to Thee to do this for
me?â€ he said to God. â€œI know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to
ask this of Thee, but for Godâ€™s sake do let the old wolf come my way
and let KarÃ¡y spring at itâ€”in sight of â€˜Uncleâ€™ who is watching
from over thereâ€”and seize it by the throat in a death grip!â€ A
thousand times during that half-hour RostÃ³v cast eager and restless
glances over the edge of the wood,or fleas,
baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.

â€œUlyulyulyu!â€ whispered RostÃ³v, pouting his lips. The borzois
jumped up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears.
KarÃ¡y finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got
up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.

â€œShall I loose them or not?â€ Nicholas asked himself as the wolf
approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolfâ€™s whoof feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to her.

â€œSheâ€™ll get away! No, itâ€™s impossible!â€ thought Nicholas, still
shouting with a hoarse voice.

â€œKarÃ¡y, ulyulyu!...â€ he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi
who was now his only hope. KarÃ¡y, with all the strength age had left
him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped
heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolfâ€™s
lope and the borzoiâ€™s slow the happiest
moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to
dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from
among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the
gully. She clicked her teeth (KarÃ¡y no longer had her by the throat),
leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and having
disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went
forward. KarÃ¡y, his hair bristling, and pro body and saw Daniel
lying on the wolfâ€™s back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the
ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself
that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and
tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took
a step, and with his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on
the wolf, seizing her by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but
Daniel whispered, â€œDonâ€™t! Wt as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday
they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees.
Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips.

Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone
in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed
before Nicholas heard one he knew, VoltÃ³rn, giving tongue at intervals;
other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A
msignal agreed on in case of a fight.

â€œThatâ€™s IlÃ¡ginâ€™s huntsman having a row with our IvÃ¡n,â€ said
Nicholasâ€™ groom.

Nicholas sent the man to call NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya to him, and rode at a
footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.
Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.

Nicholas dismounted, and with NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya, who had ridden up,
stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter  of his
arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He
rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully
prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
enemy.

Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in
a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,
accompanied by two hunt servants.

Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in IlÃ¡gin a stately and courteoush, slender but with muscles like
steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of
the swiftness of IlÃ¡ginâ€™s borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a
rival to his own MÃ­lka.

In the middle of a sober conversation begun by IlÃ¡gin about the
yearâ€™s harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.

â€œA fine little bitch, that!â€ said he in a careless tone. â€œIs she
swift?â€

â€œThat one? Yes, sheâ€™s a good dog, gets what sheâ€™s afterolding his whip
aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, â€œA-tu!â€ (This call and
the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)

â€œAh, he has found one, I think,â€ said IlÃ¡gin carelessly. â€œYes, we
must ride up.... Shall we both course it?â€ answered Nicholas, seeing
in ErzÃ¡ and â€œUncleâ€™sâ€ red RugÃ¡y two rivals he had never yet had
a chance of pitting against his own borzois. â€œAnd suppose they outdo
my MÃ­lka at once!â€ he thought as he rodborzois that
were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt,
who had been moving slowly, shouted, â€œStop!â€ calling in the hounds,
while the borzoi whips, with a cry of â€œA-tu!â€ galloped across the
field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil IlÃ¡gin, Nicholas,
NatÃ¡sha, and â€œUncleâ€ flew, reckless of where and how they went,
seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even
for an instant of the chase. The hais appeal. At the very moment when she would have
seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the
winter rye and the stubble. Again ErzÃ¡ and MÃ­lka were abreast, running
like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but
it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not
overtake him so quickly.

â€œRugÃ¡y, RugÃ¡yushka! Thatâ€™s it, come on!â€ came a third voice just
then, and â€œUncleâ€™sâ€ red borzoi, strar not.

â€œBut what is there in running across it like that?â€ said IlÃ¡ginâ€™s
groom.

â€œOnce she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take
it,â€ IlÃ¡gin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop
and his excitement. At the same moment NatÃ¡sha, without drawing
breath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set
everyoneâ€™s ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the others
expressed by all talking at once,weather, and you
could rest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.â€

â€œUncleâ€™sâ€ offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to OtrÃ¡dnoe for
a trap, while Nicholas rode with NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya to â€œUncleâ€™sâ€
house.

Some five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front
porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as
well as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
the hunters who wh the anteroom into a small hall with
a folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round
birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where
there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of SuvÃ³rov, of
the hostâ€™s father and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The
study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. â€œUncleâ€ asked his visitors
to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room.
RugÃ¡yring Nicholas a pipe with a long stem
and, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that
had been cut short. â€œSheâ€™s ridden all day like a man, and is as
fresh as ever!â€

Soon after â€œUncleâ€™sâ€ reappearance the door was opened, evidently
from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking
woman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered
carrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordialit and pleasant smiles.

â€œTake this, little Lady-Countess!â€ she kept saying, as she offered
NatÃ¡sha first one thing and then another.

NatÃ¡sha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such
buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such
a chicken anywhere. AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna left the room.

After supper, over their cherry brandy, RostÃ³v and â€œUncleâ€ talked
of past and future hunts, of RugÃ¡y and IlÃ¡ginâ€™s dogs, whild or tail of it. Thatâ€™s for youâ€”I havenâ€™t
brains enough. Now, hunting is another matterâ€”thatâ€™s it, come on!
Open the door, there!â€ he shouted. â€œWhy have you shut it?â€

The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmenâ€™s room, as they
called the room for the hunt servants.

There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the
door into the huntsmenâ€™s room, from which came the clear sounds of a
balalÃ¡yka on which someone, who wr portly person against the doorpost.

â€œYou like listening?â€ she said to NatÃ¡sha, with a smile extremely
like â€œUncleâ€™s.â€ â€œThatâ€™s a good player of ours,â€ she added.

â€œHe doesnâ€™t play that part right!â€ said â€œUncleâ€ suddenly, with
an energetic gesture. â€œHere he ought to burst outâ€”thatâ€™s it, come
on!â€”ought to burst out.â€

â€œDo you play then?â€ asked NatÃ¡sha.

â€œUncleâ€ did not answer, but smiled.

â€œAnÃ­sya, go and see if thtrings, something seemed to
snap.

â€œLovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!â€ shouted NatÃ¡sha as soon as
he had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. â€œNicholas,
Nicholas!â€ she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: â€œWhat
is it moves me so?â€

Nicholas too was greatly pleased by â€œUncleâ€™sâ€ playing, and
â€œUncleâ€ played the piece over again. AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovnaâ€™s smiling
face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces.. dance.

She did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision,
that AnÃ­sya FÃ«dorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she
watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so
different from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was
in AnÃ­sya and in AnÃ­syaâ€™s father and mother and aunt, and in every
Russian man and woman.

â€œWell, lisult of this the unconsidered
tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. NatÃ¡sha was in
ecstasies over â€œUncleâ€™sâ€ singing. She resolved to give up learning
the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked â€œUncleâ€ for his
guitar and at once found the chords of the song.

After nine oâ€™clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent
to look for them, arrived to fetch NatÃ¡sha and PÃ©tya. The count and
countess did not know where they were had all the way been trying to get and had at last
caught.

â€œGot it?â€ said Nicholas.

â€œWhat were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?â€ inquired
NatÃ¡sha.

They were fond of asking one another that question.

â€œI?â€ said Nicholas, trying to remember. â€œWell, you see, first I
thought that RugÃ¡y, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were
a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then
for his manner. What a good fellow
Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility
because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs
did not improve. NatÃ¡sha and Nicholas often noticed their parents
conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of
selling the fine ancestral RostÃ³v house and estate near Moscow. It was
not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal,
and life at OtrÃ¡dnoe was quieter than in former yeamore so at every step, and
feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and
patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her loving heart, felt
that her children were being ruined, that it was not the countâ€™s fault
for he could not help being what he wasâ€”that (though he tried to
hide it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and
his childrenâ€™s ruin, and she tried to find means of remedying the
position. From her femininers disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie
KarÃ¡gina.

â€œBut, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would
you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of
money?â€ he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question
and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.

â€œNo, you have not understood me,â€ said his mother, not knowing how
to justify herself. â€œYou have not understood me, NikÃ³lenka. It is
your happiness I wi at and worrying SÃ³nya, often pulling her up
without reason, addressing her stiffly as â€œmy dear,â€ and using the
formal â€œyouâ€ instead of the intimate â€œthouâ€ in speaking to her.
The kindhearted countess was the more vexed with SÃ³nya because that
poor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly
grateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and
unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for
finding fault with visiting some neighbors that morning,
was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was resting in his
study. SÃ³nya sat in the drawing room at the round table, copying a
design for embroidery. The countess was playing patience. NastÃ¡sya
IvÃ¡novna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old
ladies. NatÃ¡sha came into the room, went up to SÃ³nya, glanced at
what she was doing, and then went up to her mother and stood without
speaking.

â€œWhy are

â€œGo, go quickly,â€ the old man urged him.

â€œAnd you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.â€

On her way past the butlerâ€™s pantry she told them to set a samovar,
though it was not at all the time for tea.

FÃ³ka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.
NatÃ¡sha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and
asked whether the samovar was really wanted.

â€œOh dear, what a young lady!â€ said FÃ³ka, pretending to frown at
Naring fireworks to let off that night.

â€œPÃ©tya! PÃ©tya!â€ she called to him. â€œCarry me downstairs.â€

PÃ©tya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her
arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.

â€œNo, donâ€™t... the island of Madagascar!â€ she said, and jumping off
his back she went downstairs.

Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made
sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dula
sang the air of the chorus so that SÃ³nya should catch it. â€œWhere were
you going?â€ she asked.

â€œTo change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.â€

â€œYou always find something to do, but I canâ€™t,â€ said NatÃ¡sha.
â€œAnd whereâ€™s Nicholas?â€

â€œAsleep, I think.â€

â€œSÃ³nya, go and wake him,â€ said NatÃ¡sha. â€œTell him I want him to
come and sing.â€

She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
beforeor the whole household, because they were always the
same.

After tea, Nicholas, SÃ³nya, and NatÃ¡sha went to the sitting room, to
their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.





CHAPTER X

â€œDoes it ever happen to you,â€ said NatÃ¡sha to her brother, when
they settled down in the sitting room, â€œdoes it ever happen to you to
feel as if there were nothing more to comeâ€”nothing; that everything
good is past? And to feel not exactly dreamed it or were told about him.â€

â€œHe was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked
at us....â€

â€œSÃ³nya, do you remember?â€ asked Nicholas.

â€œYes, yes, I do remember something too,â€ SÃ³nya answered timidly.

â€œYou know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,â€ said
NatÃ¡sha, â€œand they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you
remember!â€

â€œOf course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.â€

ng room.

â€œThey have brought the cock, Miss,â€ she said in a whisper.

â€œIt isnâ€™t wanted, PÃ³lya. Tell them to take it away,â€ replied
NatÃ¡sha.

In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and
went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth
covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.

â€œMr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,â€ came the
old countessâ€™ voice from the drawing room.

Dimmlsaid Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat
down by them.

â€œIf we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?â€ said Nicholas.
â€œNo, that canâ€™t be!â€

â€œNot lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I
was before?â€ NatÃ¡sha rejoined with conviction. â€œThe soul is
immortalâ€”well then, if I shall always live I must have lived before,
lived for a whole eternity.â€

â€œYes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,â€ remarked Dimmler,
whoriend, and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as
bewitching as her cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad
smile and with tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She
thought of NatÃ¡sha and of her own youth, and of how there was something
unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of NatÃ¡sha and Prince
Andrew.

Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with
closed eyes.

â€œAh, Countess,â€ he said atg people had
disappeared.

Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirtâ€”this was Nicholas. A Turkish
girl was PÃ©tya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was NatÃ¡sha, and a
Circassian was SÃ³nya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.

After the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those
who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their
costumes were so good that they oka sleighs with large and
small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow,
drove up to the porch.

NatÃ¡sha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing
from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all
came out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to
one another, laughing, and shouting.

Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the
old countâ€™s with a trottthed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering
like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the
first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road, and each of
the other sleighs jolted in the same way, and rudely breaking the
frost-bound stillness, the troykas began to speed along the road, one
after the other.

â€œA hareâ€™s track, a lot of tracks!â€ rang out NatÃ¡shaâ€™s voice
through the frost-bound air.

â€œHow light olas looked back. With
screams squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
to gallopâ€”the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily
beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and
ready to put on speed when required.

Nicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and
coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.

â€œWhere are we?â€ thought he. â€œItâ€™s the KosÃ³y meadow, ut why to the
left?â€ thought Nicholas. â€œAre we getting to the MelyukÃ³vsâ€™? Is
this MelyukÃ³vka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows
what is happening to usâ€”but it is very strange and pleasant whatever
it is.â€ And he looked round in the sleigh.

â€œLook, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!â€ said one of the
strange, pretty, unfamiliar peopleâ€”the one with fine eyebrows and
mustache.

â€œI think this used to be NatÃ¡sha,â€ thought, and bears, after clearing their
throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule,
came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The
clownâ€”Dimmlerâ€”and the ladyâ€”Nicholasâ€”started a dance. Surrounded
by the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and
disguising their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves
about the room.

â€œDear me! thereâ€™s no recognizing them! And NatÃ¡sha! See whom
she looks likent do you serve in?â€
she asked NatÃ¡sha. â€œHere, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!â€
she ordered the butler who was handing things round. â€œThatâ€™s not
forbidden by his law.â€

Sometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the
dancers, whoâ€”having decided once for all that being disguised, no one
would recognize themâ€”were not at all shy, PelagÃ©ya DanÃ­lovna hid
her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with
irrepresficerâ€”comes in and sits down to table with her.â€

â€œAh! ah!â€ screamed NatÃ¡sha, rolling her eyes with horror.

â€œYes? And how... did he speak?â€

â€œYes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began persuading
her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got
frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands. Then he
caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just then....â€

â€œNow, why frighten them?â€ said Pelashe should stand and listen,
and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and
shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.

â€œWhat a darling that girl is!â€ thought he. â€œAnd what have I been
thinking of till now?â€

SÃ³nya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went
hastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people
really had made the house stuffy.

Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but evple of paces
away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had
known and always slightly feared. He was in a womanâ€™s dress, with
tousled hair and a happy smile new to SÃ³nya. She ran rapidly toward
him.

â€œQuite different and yet the same,â€ thought Nicholas, looking at her
face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak
that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her
on the lips that wore a mustacmy
mind about SÃ³nya?â€

â€œHave you told her?â€ asked NatÃ¡sha, suddenly beaming all over with
joy.

â€œOh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...
NatÃ¡shaâ€”are you glad?â€

â€œI am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I did
not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she
has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy
while SÃ³nya was not,â€ continued NatÃ¡sha. â€œNow I am soressed, but without washing off the cork mustaches, they sat a
long time talking of their happiness. They talked of how they would live
when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how
happy they would be. On NatÃ¡shaâ€™s table stood two looking glasses
which DunyÃ¡sha had prepared beforehand.

â€œOnly when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too
good!â€ said NatÃ¡sha, rising and going to the looking glasses.

â€œSit down, NatÃ¡sh away the glass she was holding and covered her
eyes with her hand.

â€œOh, NatÃ¡sha!â€ she cried.

â€œDid you see? Did you? What was it?â€ exclaimed NatÃ¡sha, holding up
the looking glass.

SÃ³nya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to get
up when she heard NatÃ¡sha say, â€œOf course she will!â€ She did not
wish to disappoint either DunyÃ¡sha or NatÃ¡sha, but it was hard to sit
still. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escalong noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would
give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time,
felt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love
for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son,
she sent for her husband and, when he came, tried briefn this case
she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She could
not help loving the countess and the whole RostÃ³v family, but neither
could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended
on that love. She was silent and sad and did not reply. Nicholas felt
the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his
mother. He first implored her to forgive him and SÃ³nya and consent to
their marriage, then he threatened aiming.

The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughterâ€™s breast,
while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.

NatÃ¡sha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded
that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that SÃ³nya should not
be troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
without his parentsâ€™ knowledge.

Firmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,
to retire frort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation. She could
not write, because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing
sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by
voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry
letters, to which she attached no importance herself, and in the rough
copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.

There was still no improvement in the countessâ€™ healt Countess HÃ©lÃ¨ne
thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre felt that
she was right, and to avoid compromising her went away to Moscow.

In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as,
driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable
tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the KrÃ©mlin
Square with its snow undisturbed by ve was not
there.

When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile,
yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men.
At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies, married and
unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of them, he was
equally amiable to all, especially after supper. â€œIl est charmant; il
nâ€™a pas de sexe,â€ * th consoled himself with the thought that he was only living
this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how
many, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily,
with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single
tooth or hair remained.

In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to
him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired
gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despisef intelligence and refinement, and they
pay homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he
was great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor
Francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The
Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their
victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French,
also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same
fourteenth of Juneo be able to take a serious part
in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and
deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and
falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he
had to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under
the burden of these insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to
any distraction in order to forget them. He frequented every kind of
society, drank much, uestions appeared as
insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up a book, and
if anyone came to see him he was glad.

Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
entrenched under the enemyâ€™s fire, if they have nothing to do, try
hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To
Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life:
some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in woolution furniture, powdered footmen, and
the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his
gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted
to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors
did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw
their host, there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the
private and intimate life of the house continued.

Latterly that private lmarrying has come and that her fate must be
decided now or never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a
mournful smile that she now had no one to write to, since Julieâ€”whose
presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the
old Ã©migrÃ© who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
evenings for years, she regretted Julieâ€™s presence and having no one
to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one to
whom ity, which was always directed against her and had
of late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to
the ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water,
it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but
this loving despotâ€”the more cruel because he loved her and for that
reason tormented himself and herâ€”knew how not merely to hurt and
humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame but she noticed
that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be
served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from
habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious,
threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to have him
conscripted for the army.

â€œHe doesnâ€™t obey... I said it twice... and he doesnâ€™t obey! She
is the first person in this house; sheâ€™s my best friend,â€ cried
the prince. â€œAnas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on
Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him
and had grown accustomed to him. MÃ©tivier came to see the prince about
twice a week.

On December 6â€”St. Nicholasâ€™ Day and the princeâ€™s name dayâ€”all
Moscow came to the princeâ€™s front door but he gave orders to admit no
one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave
to Princess Mary.

MÃ©tivier, who came in the molammed the door.

MÃ©tivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne
who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.

â€œThe prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head. Keep
calm, I will call again tomorrow,â€ said MÃ©tivier; and putting his
fingers to his lips he hastened away.

Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:
â€œSpies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a momentâ€™s peace in  the
prince in the drawing room.

BorÃ­s, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been
anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nski, and had contrived
to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an
exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.

The princeâ€™s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
society, but his little circleâ€”though not much talked about in
townâ€”was one it was more f
whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped,
or was stopped, at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the
sovereign himself.

At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleonâ€™s
seizure of the Duke of Oldenburgâ€™s territory, and the Russian Note,
hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.

â€œBonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,â€ said
Count RostopchÃ­n, repeaof the Note.

â€œDoes it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,â€ he asked, â€œso
long as its substance is forcible?â€

â€œMy dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be
easy to have a good style,â€ returned Count RostopchÃ­n.

Pierre now understood the countâ€™s dissatisfaction with the wording of
the Note.

â€œOne would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,â€
remarked the old prince. â€œThere in Petersburg they are always
writt, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate
the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.

He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,
clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told
her that he had not forgotten the morningâ€™s talk, that his decision
remained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his
speaking of it to her now.

When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the os old cudgel out of the
museum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps
out of them.â€

All were silent. The old prince looked at RostopchÃ­n with a smile and
wagged his head approvingly.

â€œWell, good-by, your excellency, keep well!â€ said RostopchÃ­n,
getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the
prince.

â€œGood-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of
hearing him!â€ said the old prince, ko Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
heiress.â€

â€œYou have observed that?â€ said Princess Mary.

â€œYes,â€ returned Pierre with a smile, â€œand this young man now
manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is
too. I can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay
siege toâ€”you or Mademoiselle Julie KarÃ¡gina. He is very attentive to
her.â€

â€œHe visits them?â€

â€œYes, very often. And do you know ss, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but
she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that
she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble
except the one he knew ofâ€”that Prince Andrewâ€™s marriage threatened
to cause a rupture between father and son.

â€œHave you any news of the RostÃ³vs?â€ she asked, to change the
subject. â€œI was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew
any day. I snd yetâ€”yes. She does not deign to be
clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.â€

Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.

â€œAh, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.â€

â€œI hear they are expected very soon,â€ said Pierre.

Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
sister-in-law as soon as the RostÃ³vs arrived and to try to accustom the
old prince to her.





CHAPTER girl but as a sexless acquaintance.

That winter the KarÃ¡ginsâ€™ house was the most agreeable and hospitable
in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large
company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight
and staying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a
promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion.
But in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and
told evn me.â€

On another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:

    La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.
    Ah! contre les douleurs il nâ€™y a pas dâ€™autre asile. *

    * Death gives relief and death is peaceful.

Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.

Julie said this was charming

â€œThere is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,â€ she
said to BorÃ­s, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a
book. â€œIt is a ray of liing and melancholy, my dear Julie,â€ she said to
the daughter. â€œBorÃ­s says his soul finds repose at your house. He has
suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,â€ said she to
the mother. â€œAh, my dear, I canâ€™t tell you how fond I have grown
of Julie latterly,â€ she said to her son. â€œBut who could help loving
her? She is an angelic being! Ah, BorÃ­s, BorÃ­s!â€â€”she paused.
â€œAnd how I pity her mother,â€ she went on; â€œtoday she showed me her
her with consolation, and she told herself that he was only shy from
love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to irritability, and not
long before BorÃ­sâ€™ departure she formed a definite plan of action.
Just as BorÃ­sâ€™ leave of absence was expiring, Anatole KurÃ¡gin made
his appearance in Moscow, and of course in the KarÃ¡ginsâ€™ drawing
room, and Julie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and
very attentive to KurÃ¡gin.

â€œMy dear,â€ said Aning he never allowed to
happen.

He checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to
avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:

â€œI did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...â€

He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability had
suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were fixed on
him with greedy expectation. â€œI can always arrange so as not to see
her ofssing her hospitality on them.

Late one evening the RostÃ³vsâ€™ four sleighs drove into MÃ¡rya
DmÃ­trievnaâ€™s courtyard in the old KonyÃºsheny street. MÃ¡rya
DmÃ­trievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter, and
her sons were all in the service.

She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,
loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach
to others for any weakness, passion, or temptationâ€”the possibility o Now what are you dawdling for?â€ she cried to the maids.
â€œGet the samovar ready!... Youâ€™ve grown plumper and prettier,â€ she
remarked, drawing NatÃ¡sha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold)
to her by the hood. â€œFoo! You are cold! Now take off your things,
quick!â€ she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand.
â€œYouâ€™re half frozen, Iâ€™m sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour,
SÃ³nya dear!â€ she added, turning to SÃ³nya and indicating by tha day passes now without some new
fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?â€ she asked the count
sternly.

â€œOne thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a
purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If you
will be so kind, Iâ€™ll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
day, and leave my lassies with you.â€

â€œAll right. All right. Theyâ€™ll be safe with me, as safe as in
Chancery! Iâ€™ll take them where they mmed to her so apart from all human affairs
that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he
loved her only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She
wanted nothing more.

â€œYou see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your
future sister-in-law. â€˜Husbandsâ€™ sisters bring up blisters,â€™
but this one wouldnâ€™t hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two
together. Tomorrow youâ€™ll go with your father to see her. Bturbation was noticeable among the
servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a
maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning
the princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced
to the RostÃ³vs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess
begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors
was Mademoiselle r a quarter of an hour, Princess, Iâ€™ll drive round to see Anna
SemÃ«novna, itâ€™s quite near in the Dogsâ€™ Square, and then Iâ€™ll
come back for her.â€

The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his
daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk
to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of
encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention
this to his daughter, but NatÃ¡sha not, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with
a visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg you
to excuse me... God is my witness, I didnâ€™t knowâ€”â€ he repeated,
stressing the word â€œGodâ€ so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
father or at NatÃ¡sha.

Nor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.
Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smilt I am
glad my brother has found happiness....â€

She paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. NatÃ¡sha noticed
this and guessed its reason.

â€œI think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,â€
she said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears
choking her.

â€œWhat have I said and what have I done?â€ thought she, as soon as she
was out of the room.

They waited a long time for NatÃ¡sha to come to dinner that day. ly. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply
embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching
inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I
would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyesâ€”how I see those
eyes!â€ thought NatÃ¡sha. â€œAnd what do his father and sister matter
to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with
his smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better nouickly slipped before the ladies and
opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the
door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before
their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy
at NatÃ¡sha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being
played. NatÃ¡sha, smoothing her gown, went in with SÃ³nya and sat down,
scanning the has on!â€

â€œThe KarÃ¡gins, Julieâ€”and BorÃ­s with them. One can see at once that
theyâ€™re engaged....â€

â€œDrubetskÃ³y has proposed?â€

â€œOh yes, I heard it today,â€ said ShinshÃ­n, coming into the
RostÃ³vsâ€™ box.

NatÃ¡sha looked in the direction in which her fatherâ€™s eyes were
turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her
face and a string of pearls round her thick red neckâ€”which NatÃ¡sha
knew was covered with powder. nudged the blushing SÃ³nya and pointed to her
former adorer.

â€œDo you recognize him?â€ said he. â€œAnd where has he sprung from?â€
he asked, turning to ShinshÃ­n. â€œDidnâ€™t he vanish somewhere?â€

â€œHe did,â€ replied ShinshÃ­n. â€œHe was in the Caucasus and ran
away from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling
prince in Persia, where he killed the Shahâ€™s brother. Now all the
Moscow ladies are mad about him! Itâ€™s â€˜DÃ³lokhov the Pe.â€

Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor
tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls,
and the curtain rose.

As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent, and
all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and all the
women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention with
eager curiosity to the stage. NatÃ¡sha too began to look at it.





CHAPTER IX
y false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the
audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she
herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
on the stage, and expressed delight which to NatÃ¡sha seemed feigned.
â€œI suppose it has to be like this!â€ she thought. She kept looking
round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then atmoved with
a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been
so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression
of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was
proceeding, he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword
and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high.
Having looked at NatÃ¡sha he approached his sister, laid his well gloved
hand on the edge of her box, nodded to hgave BorÃ­s a similar smile.

HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€™s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another
in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.

During the whole of that entrâ€™acte KurÃ¡gin stood with DÃ³lokhov
in front of the orchestra partition, looking at the RostÃ³vsâ€™ box.
NatÃ¡sha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure.
She even turned so that he should see
in white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once,
but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and
behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and
everyone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly
interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.

During this act every time NatÃ¡sha looked toward the stalls she saw
Anatole KurÃ¡gin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,friend
BolkÃ³nski, Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski,â€ she went on with special
emphasis, implying that she knew of his relation to NatÃ¡sha. To get
better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come
into her box for the rest of the performance, and NatÃ¡sha moved over to
it.

The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
walls. In the middle stood what were probablyin the
orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away,
and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise and
clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began
shouting: â€œDuport! Duport! Duport!â€ NatÃ¡sha no longer thought this
strange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.

â€œIsnâ€™t Duport delightful?â€ HÃ©lÃ¨ne asked her.

â€œOh, yes,â€ replied NatÃ¡sha.





CHAPTER X

During the entrâ€
her neck, and her bare arms. NatÃ¡sha knew for certain that he was
enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel
constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that
he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye
so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking into his
eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of
modesty she had always felt between herself and other pretty women.

NatÃ¡sha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that
he was there, behind, so close behind her.

â€œHow is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?â€ she
asked herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She ied, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she
gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.

â€œO God! I am lost!â€ she said to herself. â€œHow could I let him?â€
She sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to
realize what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand
what had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure,
and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater where theion she went over her
whole conversation with KurÃ¡gin, and again saw the face, gestures, and
tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.





CHAPTER XI

Anatole KurÃ¡gin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him
away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his
creditors demanded from his father.

His father announced to him that he wouldl means had
forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole had very soon abandoned his
wife and, for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law,
had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.

Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with
others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
never in his life done anything base. He was incapable ofshe loved much; and all
will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.â€

DÃ³lokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and
his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and
dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade KurÃ¡gin and
made use of him for his own ends.

Anatole was sincerely fond of DÃ³lokhov for his cleverness and
audacity. DÃ³lokhov, who needed Anatole KurÃ¡ginâ€™s name, position, and
connections as a guessed they were talking about the
old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her.
She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a
manservant to the VozdvÃ­zhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had
not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.
To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince,
and a fear antrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her whole
house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the
servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church. At
her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had vodka
and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was the
holiday so noticeable as in MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâ€™s broad, stern face,
which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.

Aand thereâ€™ll be some people, and if
you donâ€™t bring your lovely girlsâ€”who are prettier than Mademoiselle
Georgeâ€”I wonâ€™t know you! My husband is away in Tver or I would send
him to fetch you. You must come. You positively must! Between eight and
nine.â€

She nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied
respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the
looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. She
didthis.

â€œHow she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!â€ said HÃ©lÃ¨ne. â€œYou
must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a
reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your
fiancÃ© would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to
death.â€

â€œSo she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierreâ€”that good
Pierreâ€”have talked and laughed about this. So itâ€™s all right.â€ And
again, under HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€™s infls or let his girls out of his sight
and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle Georgeâ€™s performance was over.

Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the RostÃ³vs.
Immediately after greeting the count he went up to NatÃ¡sha and followed
her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
had at the operaâ€”gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
the absence of a moral barrier between them.

HÃ©lÃ¨ne welcomed NatÃ¡sha delrst monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.

â€œHow beautiful she is!â€ NatÃ¡sha remarked to her father who had also
risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.

â€œI donâ€™t think so when I look at you!â€ said Anatole, following
NatÃ¡sha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him. â€œYou
are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased...â€

â€œCome, come, NatÃ¡sything that went on that evening. They danced the Ã©cossaise and the
Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain.
Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt his eyes
upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let
her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that HÃ©lÃ¨ne had
followed her and spoken laughingly of her brotherâ€™s love, and that she
again met Anatole in the little sitting room. HÃ©lÃ Andrew.
She loved Prince Andrewâ€”she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. â€œElse how
could all this have happened?â€ thought she. â€œIf, after that, I could
return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to
that, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is
kind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I to
do if I love him and the other oneu.â€

Count RostÃ³v approved of this suggestion, appreciating its
reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better to
visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding,
against his wishes, could only be arranged at OtrÃ¡dnoe.

â€œThat is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took
her,â€ said the old count.

â€œNo, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he
wonâ€™tâ€”thatâ€™s his affairis
ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be
forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his
son happy.â€ Princess Mary went on to ask NatÃ¡sha to fix a time when
she could see her again.

After reading the letter NatÃ¡sha sat down at the writing table
to answer it. â€œDear Princess,â€ she wrote in French quickly and
mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all that
had happened the evening bth a mysterious
air. â€œA man told me to give you thisâ€”â€ and she handed NatÃ¡sha a
letter.

â€œOnly, for Christâ€™s sake...â€ the girl went on, as NatÃ¡sha,
without thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter
from Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only
that it was a letter from himâ€”from the man she loved. Yes, she loved
him, or else how could that have happened which had happened? And how
could she have a love letter ppy. Clutching her breast to keep herself
from choking, SÃ³nya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat
down in an armchair and burst into tears.

â€œHow was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have
left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let KurÃ¡gin go to
such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, thatâ€™s plain! What will
Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is
the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnn!â€ said NatÃ¡sha, with momentary vexation.

â€œBut I canâ€™t believe it,â€ insisted SÃ³nya. â€œI donâ€™t
understand. How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and
suddenly... Why, you have only seen him three times! NatÃ¡sha, I donâ€™t
believe you, youâ€™re joking! In three days to forget everything and
so...â€

â€œThree days?â€ said NatÃ¡sha. â€œIt seems to me Iâ€™ve loved him a
hundred years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You
caâ€ NatÃ¡sha entreated. â€œRemember no one ought to interfere in such
matters! I have confided in you....â€

â€œBut why this secrecy? Why doesnâ€™t he come to the house?â€ asked
SÃ³nya. â€œWhy doesnâ€™t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince
Andrew gave you complete freedomâ€”if it is really so; but I donâ€™t
believe it! NatÃ¡sha, have you considered what these secret reasons can
be?â€

NatÃ¡sha looked at SÃ³nya with astonishment. Evidently this question
pr
into sobs and ran from the room.

NatÃ¡sha went to the table and without a momentâ€™s reflection wrote
that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all
the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their
misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the
magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her
if she had been to blame toward hederstand this...â€

â€œWait a bit, SÃ³nya, youâ€™ll understand everything. Youâ€™ll see what
a man he is! Now donâ€™t think badly of me or of him. I donâ€™t think
badly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?â€

SÃ³nya did not succumb to the tender tone NatÃ¡sha used toward her.
The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of NatÃ¡shaâ€™s face
became, the more serious and stern grew SÃ³nyaâ€™s.

â€œNatÃ¡sha,â€ said she, â€œyou asked me noons at random, began sentences she did not
finish, and laughed at everything.

After tea SÃ³nya noticed a housemaid at NatÃ¡shaâ€™s door timidly
waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at
the door learned that another letter had been delivered.

Then suddenly it became clear to SÃ³nya that NatÃ¡sha had some dreadful
plan for that evening. SÃ³nya knocked at her door. NatÃ¡sha did not let
her in.

â€œShe will run away with him!â€ thought n. NatÃ¡sha had promised to come out to KurÃ¡gin at the
back porch at ten that evening. KurÃ¡gin was to put her into a troyka
he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of
KÃ¡menka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a
marriage ceremony over them. At KÃ¡menka a relay of horses was to wait
which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would
hasten abroad with post horses.

Anatole had a passport, an order for nd turned to Anatole with an
ironic smile:

â€œDo you know? Youâ€™d really better drop it all. Thereâ€™s still
time!â€

â€œFool,â€ retorted Anatole. â€œDonâ€™t talk nonsense! If you only
knew... itâ€™s the devil knows what!â€

â€œNo, really, give it up!â€ said DÃ³lokhov. â€œI am speaking
seriously. Itâ€™s no joke, this plot youâ€™ve hatched.â€

â€œWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?â€ said Anatole, making a
grimace. â€œReally itâ€™s no time for your srooking
one finger, â€œthen I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no
matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it. Isnâ€™t that so? And
donâ€™t talk to me, donâ€™t, donâ€™t.â€

â€œSeriously, youâ€™d better drop it! Youâ€™ll only get yourself into a
mess!â€

â€œGo to the devil!â€ cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the
room, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of
DÃ³lokhov with his feet turned under him. â€œItâ€™s thnce when Anatoleâ€™s
regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the
evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again
the next night. More than once he had enabled DÃ³lokhov to escape when
pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies
and â€œladykinsâ€ as he called the cocottes. More than once in their
service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets
of Moscow and had always been proemenâ€ he always drove himself and never demanded anything for
his work. Only a couple of times a yearâ€”when he knew from their valets
that they had money in handâ€”he would turn up of a morning quite sober
and with a deep bow would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always
made him sit down.

â€œDo help me out, Theodore IvÃ¡nych, sir,â€ or â€œyour excellency,â€
he would say. â€œI am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to
go to the fair.â€

And Anatoes, sit down!â€ said DÃ³lokhov.

â€œIâ€™ll stand, Theodore IvÃ¡nych.â€

â€œSit down; nonsense! Have a drink!â€ said Anatole, and filled a large
glass of Madeira for him.

The driverâ€™s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing
it for mannersâ€™ sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
handkerchief he took out of his cap.

â€œAnd when are we to start, your excellency?â€

â€œWell...â€ Anatole looked at his watch. â€œWeâ€™ll start at handsome face. Having looked in a mirror,
and standing before DÃ³lokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it,
he lifted a glass of wine.

â€œWell, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!â€ said
Anatole. â€œWell, comrades and friends...â€ he considered for a moment â€œ...
of my youth, farewell!â€ he said, turning to MakÃ¡rin and the others.

Though they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to make
something touching and solemn oumust go backâ€”but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing
and carry her to the sleigh.â€

The valet brought a womanâ€™s fox-lined cloak.

â€œFool, I told you the sable one! Hey, MatrÃ«na, the sable!â€ he shouted so
that his voice rang far through the rooms.

A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable
mantle on her arm.

â€œHere, I donâ€™t grudge itâ€”take it!â€g cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the
ArbÃ¡t Street.

After taking a turn along the PodnovÃ­nski Boulevard, BalagÃ¡ began to
rein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old KonyÃºsheny
Street.

The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole
and DÃ³lokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the gate
DÃ³lokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.

â€œCome into the courtyard orotman to bring them up to her, she
seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors.

When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run
away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced
through the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward
midnight she went to NatÃ¡shaâ€™s room fingering the key in her pocket.
SÃ³nya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. â€œMÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, for Godâ€™s
sake let me in to hetÃ¡sha
looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her
cheeks sunken.

â€œLet me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!â€ she muttered,
wrenching herself from MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievnaâ€™s hands with a vicious effort
and sinking down again into her former position.

â€œNatalie!â€ said MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. â€œI wish for your good. Lie still,
stay like that then, I wonâ€™t touch you. But listen. I wonâ€™t tell you how
guilty you are. You know that yoursll hate and despise me!â€ and she threw herself
back on the sofa.

MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on her
that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody
would know anything about it if only NatÃ¡sha herself would undertake
to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened.
NatÃ¡sha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she grew cold
and had a shivering fit. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna put a at is the matter
with you, my angel? Are you ill?â€ asked the count.

After a momentâ€™s silence NatÃ¡sha answered: â€œYes, ill.â€

In reply to the countâ€™s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected
and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him
that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna
confirmed NatÃ¡shaâ€™s assurances that nothing had happened. From
the pretense of illness, from his daughterâ€™s distress,rry up and come and marry her!â€ thought he on his way to the house.

On the TverskÃ³y Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.

â€œPierre! Been back long?â€ someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In
a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the
dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion MakÃ¡rin dashed
past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military
dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver comouthed to what was told
him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrewâ€™s
deeply loved affianced wifeâ€”the same NatÃ¡sha RostÃ³va who used to be so
charmingâ€”should give up BolkÃ³nski for that fool Anatole who was already
secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as
to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive
and could not imagine.

He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of NatÃ¡st challenge Anatole to a duel,
and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to
leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierreâ€”only
now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince
Andrewâ€”promised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly
explained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.

â€œMind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,â€
she said. â€œAnd I willre gray locks on his temples the count left the
room.

When MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna told NatÃ¡sha that Anatole was married, NatÃ¡sha
did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre
himself. SÃ³nya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to
NatÃ¡shaâ€™s room.

NatÃ¡sha, pale and stern, was sitting beside MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, and her
eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the
moment he entered. She did not smile oembers who were assembling for dinner were sitting about
in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news. The footman
having greeted him, knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him
there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that Prince
Michael ZakhÃ¡rych was in the library, but Paul TimofÃ©evich had not yet
arrived. One of Pierreâ€™s acquaintances, while they were talking about
the weather, asked if he had heard of KurÃ¡ginâ€™s abducti which she knew and had herself experienced after his
duel with DÃ³lokhov.

â€œWhere you are, there is vice and evil!â€ said Pierre to his wife.
â€œAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,â€ he added in French.

Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to
follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself
and was leading him from the room.

â€œIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...â€ whispered HÃ©lÃ¨ne, but
Pird
Anatole.

Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket
and drew out his pocketbook.

Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table
that stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.

â€œI shanâ€™t be violent, donâ€™t be afraid!â€ said Pierre in answer to a
frightened gesture of Anatoleâ€™s. â€œFirst, the letters,â€ said he, as if
repeating a lesson to himself. â€œSecondly,â€ he continued after a short
pause, agnced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he
wanted.

â€œThough it was tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte,â€ Anatole continued, â€œstill I canâ€™t...â€

â€œIs it satisfaction you want?â€ said Pierre ironically.

â€œYou could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do as
you wish, eh?â€

â€œI take them back, I take them back!â€ said Pierre, â€œand I ask you to
forgive me.â€ Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. â€œAnd if
you require money fÃ¡shaâ€™s reputation.

He was awaiting Prince Andrewâ€™s return with dread and went every day to
the old princeâ€™s for news of him.

Old Prince BolkÃ³nski heard all the rumors current in the town from
Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which
NatÃ¡sha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than
usual and awaited his son with great impatience.

Some days after Anatoleâ€™s departure Pierre received a note from Prince

how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince
Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh
horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing
his father and Prince MeshchÃ©rski, warmly disputing and vigorously
gesticulating. The conversation was about SperÃ¡nskiâ€”the news of whose
sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.

â€œNow he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiasth he was only too
familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate.
When Prince MeshchÃ©rski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierreâ€™s arm and
asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made
up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince
Andrew went to one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a
packet wrapped in paper. He dimay ask?â€ he said.

â€œHe has gone to Peters... But I donâ€™t know,â€ said Pierre.

â€œWell, it doesnâ€™t matter,â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œTell Countess RostÃ³va
that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is
good.â€

Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether
he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say
anything, looked fixedly at him.

â€œI say, do you remember our discussion in Petersbim. NatÃ¡sha was in bed, the count at the club, and Pierre,
after giving the letters to SÃ³nya, went to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna who was
interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes
later SÃ³nya came to MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna.

â€œNatÃ¡sha insists on seeing Count Peter KirÃ­lovich,â€ said she.

â€œBut how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been
tidied up.â€

â€œNo, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,â€ said SÃ³nya.


â€œYes... I will tell him,â€ answered Pierre; â€œbut...â€

He did not know what to say.

NatÃ¡sha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she
had meant.

â€œNo, I know all is over,â€ she said hurriedly. â€œNo, that can never be.
Iâ€™m only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only that I
beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....â€

She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.

A sense of pity he had never b said he to her.

â€œBefore me? No! All is over for me,â€ she replied with shame and
self-abasement.

â€œAll over?â€ he repeated. â€œIf I were not myself, but the handsomest,
cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this moment
ask on my knees for your hand and your love!â€

For the first time for many days NatÃ¡sha wept tears of gratitude and
tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.

Pierre too when she had gone almost  world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long
luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed
joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having
traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable
space, seemed suddenlyâ€”like an arrow piercing the earthâ€”to remain
fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and
displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars. Irnich,
RumyÃ¡ntsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have
taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to
have written to Alexander: â€œMy respected Brother, I consent to restore
the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburgâ€â€”and there would have been no war.

We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries.
It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by Englandâ€™s
intrigues (as in fact he said onlence: why because the
Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed
and ruined the people of SmolÃ©nsk and Moscow and were killed by them.

To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried
away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event
with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present
themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of
them we find; and each separane cause for that occurrence, but it had
to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human
feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows,
just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east
to the west, slaying their fellows.

The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed
to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
drawn into the campaign by lot or by consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in
the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done
is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of
millions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man
stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with
and the more power he has over others, the more evident is the
predestination and inevitability of his every action.

â€œThe kingâ€™diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of
contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace,
but which only wounded the self-love of both sides, and millions of
other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or
coincided with it.

When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its
attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried
by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the his ownâ€”that is, which he had taken from other kingsâ€”to the Empress
of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the
Empress Marie Louiseâ€”who regarded him as her husband, though he had left
another wife in Parisâ€”left her grieved by the parting which she seemed
hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in
the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though
the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a lettJune he came out of his tent,
which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and
looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of
the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across
the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperorâ€™s presence, were on the
lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat
and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on
the hill, they thrtinually by incessant and rapturous
acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting,
but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
time he joined the army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon
bridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in
the direction of Khis excess of zeal.

As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer,
with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted â€œVivat!â€
and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped
into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown
restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest
part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after
him. It was cold and out on the further bank. And as soon as they had
got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted â€œVivat!â€
and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he
no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.

That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper
money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as
possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter
containin
the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received.
The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by
subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the
Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a
landowner in the VÃ­lna province, offered his country house for the fete,
and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and
fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsenâ€™s country seat.

The vere. BorÃ­s, coolly looking at HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€™s dazzling bare shoulders
which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her
of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and
unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor
who was in the same room. The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the
doorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which
he alone knew how to utter.

As the mazurka began,
could find it out before others. In the figure in which he had to choose
two ladies, he whispered to HÃ©lÃ¨ne that he meant to choose Countess
Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over
the parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing BalashÃ«v
and the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were
moving toward the door. BorÃ­s, fluttering as if he had not had time to
withdraw, respectfully pressed close to the dto the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal
Prince SaltykÃ³v, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on
Russian soil.

Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:

Monsieur mon frÃ¨re,

Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept
my engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian
frontier, and I have this moment received from Peas a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told
him to transmit those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them
in his letter to Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt
it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at
reconciliation was being made, but he definitely instructed BalashÃ«v to
repeat them personally to Napoleon.

Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a
bugler and two Cossad him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the
village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked
silently at one another from time to time.

A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came
riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied
by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked
smart and well kept.

It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
triing in the bright June sunshine.

BalashÃ«v was only two horsesâ€™ length from the equestrian with the
bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping
toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the
French colonel, whispered respectfully: â€œThe King of Naples!â€ It was,
in fact, Murat, now called â€œKing of Naples.â€ Though it was quite
incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so,
and was himself convihose name he could not pronounce.

â€œDe Bal-machÃ¨ve!â€ said the King (overcoming by his assurance the
difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). â€œCharmed to
make your acquaintance, General!â€ he added, with a gesture of kingly
condescension.

As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity
instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his
natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the
withers of war.

â€œOh, my dear general!â€ Murat again interrupted him, â€œwith all my heart I
wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war
begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!â€ said he,
in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another
despite a quarrel between their masters.

And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his
health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he to face
danger, and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to
maintain his powerful position with Alexander, whose own character was
chivalrous, noble, and gentle.

BalashÃ«v found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasantâ€™s hut,
writingâ€”he was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been
found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put
themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for
beinorders are obeyed in your army, but here,â€ said Davout,
â€œyou must do as youâ€™re told.â€

And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his
dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer
on duty.

BalashÃ«v took out the packet containing the Emperorâ€™s letter and laid it
on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid
across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.

â€œYou a honor him
with an audience.

Four days before, sentinels of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment had stood in
front of the house to which BalashÃ«v was conducted, and now two French
grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with
shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a
brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting
for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle
horse and his M
lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck
stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled
of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, with its
prominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial
welcome.

He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly
thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick
shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protWhen Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the
Russian envoy, BalashÃ«v began a speech he had prepared long before:
â€œSire! The Emperor, my master...â€ but the sight of the Emperorâ€™s eyes
bent on him confused him. â€œYou are flurriedâ€”compose yourself!â€ Napoleon
seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at
BalashÃ«vâ€™s uniform and sword.

BalashÃ«v recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the
Emperor Alexander rily
noticed the quivering of Napoleonâ€™s left leg which increased the more
Napoleon raised his voice.

â€œI desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,â€ he began. â€œHave
I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I
have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin
negotiations, what is demanded of me?â€ he said, frowning and making an
energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.

â€œThe withdrawal of d you offer me negotiations when I
have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when
your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the
aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?â€ he continued
hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace
and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and
power and Alexanderâ€™s errors and duplicity.

The commencement of his speech ha. â€œAll that, he would have
owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!â€ he repeated several
times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to
his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.

â€œWhat a splendid reign the Emperor Alexanderâ€™s might have been!â€

He looked compassionately at BalashÃ«v, and as soon as the latter tried
to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.

â€œWhat could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained all that happens. A sovereign should not be with
the army unless he is a general!â€ said Napoleon, evidently uttering
these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander
desired to be a military commander.

â€œThe campaign began only a week ago, and you havenâ€™t even been able to
defend VÃ­lna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish
provinces. Your army is grumbling.â€

â€œOn the contrary, Your Majesty,â€ said BalashÃ«v, has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is
in the right. BalashÃ«v began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared
to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man,
he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently
seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon
had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them
when he came to his senses. BalashÃ«v stood with said in a
quiet voice:

â€œAnd yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!â€

BalashÃ«v, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the
Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was
silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to
him. BalashÃ«v said that in Russia the best results were expected from
the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, â€œI know itâ€™s
your duty to say that, but yaint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,
but, on the contrary, tried to reassure BalashÃ«v. It was evident that
he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a
mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not
because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he
did it.

The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through VÃ­lna, where
crowds of people had rapturously greeted and follœI beg your Majestyâ€™s pardon,â€ returned BalashÃ«v, â€œbesides Russia there
is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.â€

This reply of BalashÃ«vâ€™s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the
French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexanderâ€™s
court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleonâ€™s dinner, where it
passed unnoticed.

The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they
were puzzled as to w€œThey tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange,
isnâ€™t it, General?â€ he said, evidently not doubting that this remark
would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleonâ€™s,
superiority to Alexander.

BalashÃ«v made no reply and bowed his head in silence.

â€œYes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were
deliberating,â€ continued Napoleon with the same derisive and
self-confident smile. â€œWhat I canâ€™te were doing something not merely important but pleasing to
BalashÃ«v, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian generalâ€™s
face and, taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips
only.

To have oneâ€™s ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest
honor and mark of favor at the French court.

â€œWell, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why donâ€™t you say
anything?â€ said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to bnd so he wanted to meet KurÃ¡gin
personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again
failed to meet KurÃ¡gin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived,
the latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions,
Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken
faith with himâ€”which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to
conceal its effectsâ€”the surroundings in which he had been happy became
trying to him,imâ€”he knew that when he did meet him he would not
be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help
snatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet
avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and
poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in
Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and
ambitious activity.

In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon rh, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her
existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become
more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had
brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and
talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly
intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince
had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a
noti the young Count KÃ¡menskyâ€™s campaign, the old prince
began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her
superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said,
was the only person really attached to him.

The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess
Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by
indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The
old prince knew very well â€

â€œFather, I did not want to judge,â€ said Prince Andrew, in a hard and
bitter tone, â€œbut you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall
say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blameâ€”the one to blameâ€”is
that Frenchwoman.â€

â€œAh, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!â€ said the old man in a
low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment,
but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: â€œBe off, be off! Let not a
trac
soon as possible.

â€œSo youâ€™ve decided to go, Andrew?â€ asked his sister.

â€œThank God that I can,â€ replied Prince Andrew. â€œI am very sorry you
canâ€™t.â€

â€œWhy do you say that?â€ replied Princess Mary. â€œWhy do you say that,
when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle
Bourienne says he has been asking about you....â€

As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears
began to fall. Prince Andrew turgan thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet
KurÃ¡gin who he knew was now in the army.

Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how
unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to
him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again
from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the
longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.

â€œGood- would
extend farther than the western, the Polish, provinces.

Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on
the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large
village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and
courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the
villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay
de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperorlf the following of the state of affairs.

While the Emperor had still been at VÃ­lna, the forces had been divided
into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the
army under BagratiÃ³n, and thirdly, the one commanded by TormÃ¡sov. The
Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the
orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command,
but only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had
wit
courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not
assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies;
the men around him were his assistants. ArakchÃ©ev was a faithful
custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereignâ€™s bodyguard.
Bennigsen was a landlord in the VÃ­lna province who appeared to be doing
the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful
as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. Thy theorists
who believed in a science of war with immutable lawsâ€”laws of oblique
movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded
a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise
laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism,
ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To
this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and
others, chiefly Germans.

The second pists are often one-sided, and therefore one
should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuelâ€™s
opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and
then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp
at Drissa, according to Pfuelâ€™s plan, but on changing the movements of
the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other
could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this thirdr army is well
organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering
any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to
be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his
incapacity already in 1807.â€

The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any
rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: â€œand
twist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually.
Let ty be
raised to the highest pitch.

The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the
others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither
peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa
or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor
Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thingâ€”as much advantage
and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of
conflicting and intersecfavor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole
drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it
was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the
uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving
a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of
intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity
of race among these peopleâ€”this eighth and largest pa chief, if independent,
would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and
authority of the monarch.

Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,
ShishkÃ³v, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of
this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which ArakchÃ©ev and BalashÃ«v
agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him
by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfry banks of the river. Neither
Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but ChernÃ½shev, the Emperorâ€™s
aide-de-camp, received BolkÃ³nski and informed him that the Emperor,
accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second
time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the
suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.

ChernÃ½shev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel
in his hand. This roich fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince
Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about
him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German
theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more
typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German
theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to
such an extent.

Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-ing contemptuously, went on into the room
from which the sound of voices was heard.

Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly
disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect
and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with
Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to
form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly
and immutably self-confident men, s and therefore could not serve as
material for science.

In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of
campaign that ended in Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt, but he did not see the least
proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On
the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion,
the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically
gleeful sarcasm he would remark, â€œThere, I said the whole affair tening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward
evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited
Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.

â€œAnd as for the man who advised forming this campâ€”the Drissa camp,â€ said
Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew
scanned his unfamiliar face, â€œas to that person, sire...â€ continued
Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain hoint the army should unite and
there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that
plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions
putâ€”which, in fact, his plan did not answerâ€”as to avail himself of the
opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as
good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown
what character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others
defended them. etter than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There
is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly
adhered to,â€ said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. â€œWhat
is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!â€

He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no
eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that
everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to
outflank it, anything for himself, nursed no
hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a
theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was
ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary
respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks
of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable
at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleonâ€™s
genius, which, thount at what they were saying. A thought that had
long since and often occurred to him during his military activitiesâ€”the
idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that
therefore there can be no such thing as a military geniusâ€”now appeared
to him an obvious truth. â€œWhat theory and science is possible about a
matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot
be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot  power,
attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best
generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded
men. BagratiÃ³n was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of
Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the
field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any
special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest
and best human attributesâ€”love, poetry, tendery attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the
army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry NatÃ¡sha was ill and her
engagement broken off, and that he would do all he could to meet their
wishes. To SÃ³nya he wrote separately.

â€œAdored friend of my soul!â€ he wrote. â€œNothing but honor could keep
me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the
campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comradesâ€™ eyes but
in my own, if Iis old squadron.

The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay,
new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was
infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement
of a war, and RostÃ³v, conscious of his advantageous position in the
regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of
military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to
relinquish them.

The troops retook also horses,
carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. RostÃ³v remembered
SventsyÃ¡ni, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town
he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken
men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels
of old beer. From SventsyÃ¡ni they retired farther and farther to Drissa,
and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of Russia
proper.

On the thirteœa Russian Thermopylae,â€ and of how a deed worthy
of antiquity had been performed by General RaÃ©vski. He recounted how
RaÃ©vski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had
charged with them beside him. RostÃ³v heard the story and not only said
nothing to encourage Zdrzhinskiâ€™s enthusiasm but, on the contrary,
looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no
intention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and
of 18ed
to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his
thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew
that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to
pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.

â€œI canâ€™t stand this any more,â€ said IlyÃ­n, noticing that RostÃ³v did not
relish Zdrzhinskiâ€™s conversation. â€œMy stockings and shirt... and the
water is running on my seat! Iâ€™ll go and look for shelterand IlyÃ­n, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts
and laughter.

â€œDear me, how jolly we are!â€ said RostÃ³v laughing.

â€œAnd why do you stand there gaping?â€

â€œWhat swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Donâ€™t make our
drawing room so wet.â€

â€œDonâ€™t mess Mary HendrÃ­khovnaâ€™s dress!â€ cried other voices.

RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n hastened to find a corner where they could change into
dry clothes without offending Mary HendrÃ­ddy that one could
not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held
only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to
take turns in order of seniority to receive oneâ€™s tumbler from Mary
HendrÃ­khovnaâ€™s plump little hands with their short and not overclean
nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with
her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon
left their game and came over to theary HendrÃ­khovna. They drew
lots to settle who should make up her set. At RostÃ³vâ€™s suggestion it
was agreed that whoever became â€œKingâ€ should have the right to kiss Mary
HendrÃ­khovnaâ€™s hand, and that the â€œBoobyâ€ should go to refill and reheat
the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.

â€œWell, but supposing Mary HendrÃ­khovna is â€˜Kingâ€™?â€ asked IlyÃ­n.

â€œAs it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!â€

They had hardly begun to play befoe officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their
wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged
remarks, recalling the doctorâ€™s uneasiness and his wifeâ€™s delight, now
they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the
covered trap. Several times RostÃ³v, covering his head, tried to go
to sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be
resumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, chd gone
on in front.

Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding
before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass
which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still
wet with the nightâ€™s rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also
wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one
side. The soldiersâ€™ faces were more and more clearly visible. RostÃ³v,
always closely followed by Ily merely out for a ride. He
glanced with pity at the excited face of IlyÃ­n, who talked much and in
great agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of
terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could
help him.

As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds,
the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning
after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and
abe heard
briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.

At these sounds, long unheard, RostÃ³vâ€™s spirits rose, as at the strains
of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together,
now several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then
again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding
them.

The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade
began. Count Ostermann with his suite rodecatch
sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and
nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons
pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small
at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their
arms and their sabers in the air.

RostÃ³v gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt
instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the
latter codragoons who galloped after
them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the
foremost began to turn, while those behind began to halt. With the same
feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, RostÃ³v
gave rein to his DonÃ©ts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the
dragoonsâ€™ disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot
flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless
horse fell in ided what to do with him, the officer cried, â€œI
surrender!â€ He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the
stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from RostÃ³vâ€™s face.
Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the
saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was
wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his
horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms roundthe dimple on his chin. He was sitting in
his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about
him. The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He
glanced at RostÃ³v with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting.
RostÃ³v still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.

All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that RostÃ³v,
without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied.
He drank reluctansideration of all that had caused the illness,
her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the
background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider
in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat
or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them
feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help
her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in
Frenn, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied
that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that
something should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They
satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it
wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself
and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching
spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child
caess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid
for not strictly obeying the doctorâ€™s orders?

â€œYouâ€™ll never get well like that,â€ she would say, forgetting her grief
in her vexation, â€œif you wonâ€™t obey the doctor and take your medicine at
the right time! You mustnâ€™t trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to
pneumonia,â€ she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of
that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well t
little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that
she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the
stifling atmosphere of the town, and the RostÃ³vs did not move to the
country that summer of 1812.

In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out
of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of
such things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of
the country lifeime! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at
the time had not deceived herâ€”that that state of freedom and readiness
for any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live
on.

It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly
imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But
this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, â€œWhat next?â€
But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yetings;
and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted
her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort
a crying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because
NatÃ¡sha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of
which she had experienced with KurÃ¡gin that it never entered her head
that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her
part, still less on his, or even to te clear light of dawn.
By AgrafÃ©na IvÃ¡novnaâ€™s advice NatÃ¡sha prepared herself not in their
own parish, but at a church where, according to the devout AgrafÃ©na
IvÃ¡novna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were
never many people in the church; NatÃ¡sha always stood beside BelÃ³va in
the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the
screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of
humility before soth the word, called it, seemed to NatÃ¡sha
so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.

But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in
white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for
many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life
that lay before her.

The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the
powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.
ay, the RostÃ³vs went to Mass at the RazumÃ³vskisâ€™ private chapel
as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten oâ€™clock, when the RostÃ³vs
got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of
hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves
of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white
trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on
the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine t, recalling that she had been here
the Sunday before, â€œand always the same life that is no life, and the
same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live. Iâ€™m pretty,
Iâ€™m young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I
know I am good,â€ she thought, â€œbut yet my best years are slipping by
and are no good to anyone.â€ She stood by her motherâ€™s side and exchanged
nods with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladiesâation of our souls.â€

â€œFor the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,â€ prayed
NatÃ¡sha.

When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and
DenÃ­sov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she
remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her
all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us,
she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and
SÃ³nya, reetting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some
invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself,
from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.

The countess looked round several times at her daughterâ€™s softened face
and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.

Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order
NatÃ¡sha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he
knelt on when praying on Trrtakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by
Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou
gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over
Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who
have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength
for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us;
confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may
alvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice
in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath
the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor,
and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all
glory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without
end. Amen.â€

In NatÃ¡shaâ€™s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her
strongly. She listened to every word about the vitself. That terrible question â€œWhy?â€ â€œWherefore?â€ which had come to him
amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a
reply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or
himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of
human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did
not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so
transient and incomprehensibleâ€”but he rntly sought everywhere for signs of that
approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had revealed to
Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the
Revelation of St. John.

In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:

Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of
the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred
threescore and six.

And in the fifth verse of the same chapter:

And teur
Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums
were either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations he
wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the
sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling,
substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le, still
without obtaining the desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the
answer to the question were contained in his name, his v to his father. Pierre
took that letter, and RostopchÃ­n also gave him the Emperorâ€™s appeal to
Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own
most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in
one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of
Nicholas RostÃ³v, awarded a St. Georgeâ€™s Cross of the Fourth Class for
courage shown in the OstrÃ³vna affair, and in the same order the name
of Prince Andrew  the chief
reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the
vague idea that he was Lâ€™russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast,
666; that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the
power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been
predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake
anything, but wait for what was bound to come to pass.





CHAPTER XX

A few intimate friends were dininerre had not seen in her for a long time. â€œYou know Nicholas
has received a St. Georgeâ€™s Cross? I am so proud of him.â€

â€œOh yes, I sent that announcement. But I donâ€™t want to interrupt you,â€
he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.

NatÃ¡sha stopped him.

â€œCount, is it wrong of me to sing?â€ she said blushing, and fixing her
eyes inquiringly on him.

â€œNo... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?â€

â€œI donâ€™t kno, she turned away, lifted her music
before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and
down the room.

Just then PÃ©tya came running in from the drawing room.

PÃ©tya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and
resembled NatÃ¡sha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and
his friend ObolÃ©nski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.

PÃ©tya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair.
He h I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve done with it,â€ he said.

â€œThere he is, always losing everything!â€ remarked the countess.

NatÃ¡sha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and
sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierreâ€™s
features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still
searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.

â€œNo, really! Iâ€™ll drive home, I must have left them there. Iâ€™ll
certai grasp what was said. He looked at the count.

â€œOh yes, the war,â€ he said. â€œNo! What sort of warrior should I make? And
yet everything is so strange, so strange! I canâ€™t make it out. I donâ€™t
know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no
one can answer for himself.â€

After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and
with a serious face asked SÃ³nya, who was considered an excellent reader,
to read the appeal.
o bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered
from bondage glorify the name of Russia!â€


â€œYes, thatâ€™s it!â€ cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing
repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he
added, â€œLet the Emperor but say the word and weâ€™ll sacrifice everything
and begrudge nothing.â€

Before ShinshÃ­n had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the
countâ€™s patriotism, NatÃ¡sha jump same I canâ€™t study now when...â€ PÃ©tya
stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,
â€œwhen our Fatherland is in danger.â€

â€œThatâ€™ll do, thatâ€™ll doâ€”nonsense....â€

â€œBut you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.â€

â€œPÃ©tya! Be quiet, I tell you!â€ cried the count, with a glance at his
wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.

â€œAnd I tell youâ€”Peter KirÃ­lych here will also tell you...es. He tried
to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently
kissed her hand and went out.

Pierre made up his mind not to go to the RostÃ³vsâ€™ any more.





CHAPTER XXI

After the definite refusal he had received, PÃ©tya went to his room
and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea,
silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to
notice anything.

Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow,in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he
was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the
patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,
rumbling beneath the archway. Beside PÃ©tya stood a peasant woman, a
footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some
time in the gateway, PÃ©tya tried to move forward in front of the others
ices of the crowd that filled the whole KrÃ©mlin.

For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared,
and everyone rushed forward in one direction. PÃ©tya was being pressed so
that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, â€œHurrah! hurrah!
hurrah!â€ PÃ©tya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see
nothing except the people about him.

All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A
tradesmanâ€™s wifeshabby blue cassockâ€”probably a church clerk and
chanterâ€”was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off
the pressure of the crowd with the other.

â€œYouâ€™ve crushed the young gentleman!â€ said the clerk. â€œWhat are you up
to? Gently!... Theyâ€™ve crushed him, crushed him!â€

The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread
out again more evenly, and the clerk led PÃ©tyaâ€”pale and breathlessâ€”to
the Tsar-cannon. Several pests who
were officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used
the word â€œplenaryâ€ (of the service), a word PÃ©tya did not understand.
Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking
nuts. All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls,
were such as might have had a particular charm for PÃ©tya at his age, but
they did not interest him now. He sat on his elevationâ€”the pedestal of
the cannonâ€”still agitated as bpalace, and began
to disperse. It was already late, and PÃ©tya had not eaten anything and
was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with
that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while
the Emperor dinedâ€”looking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew
not what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance
to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table,
glimpses of whom could be serrah!â€ with a voice already hoarse.

The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began
to disperse.

â€œThere! I said if only we waitedâ€”and so it was!â€ was being joyfully said
by various people.

Happy as PÃ©tya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all
the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from
the KrÃ©mlin, but called on his friend ObolÃ©nski, who was fifteen and was
also entering the regiment. Ond were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached
themselves to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces
of the crowd PÃ©tya had seen in the Square, there was a striking
contradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event, and at the
same time the everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook,
ZinaÃ­da DmÃ­trievnaâ€™s health, and so on.

Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a noblemanâ€™s
uniform that had becd him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round
the speaker and listened. Count IlyÃ¡ RostÃ³v, in a military uniform of
Catherineâ€™s time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd,
with all of whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and
listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did,
to what the speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very
boldly, as was evident from the expression on the faces of tovâ€™weignâ€ (that was the way he referred to
the Emperor) â€œneed only say the word and weâ€™ll all die foâ€™ him!â€ added
the orator with animation.

Count RostÃ³vâ€™s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but
Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,
but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he
opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his
head, with a shrewd though angry es
their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which
we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,â€ he went on, warming to his
subject, â€œthat the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us
merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, and
chair Ã  canon * we are ready to make of ourselvesâ€”and not to obtain from
us any co-co-counsel.â€

    * â€œFood for cannon.â€


Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticino, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre,
interrupted AdrÃ¡ksin.

â€œYes, and this is not a time for discussing,â€ he continued, â€œbut for
acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy
Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives
and children.â€ The nobleman smote his breast. â€œWe will all arise,
everyone of us will go, for our father the Tsar!â€ he shouted, rolling
his bloodshot eyes. Several approving vogible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the
latter. Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in
the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.

GlÃ­nka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries
of â€œauthor! author!â€ were heard in the crowd), said that â€œhell must be
repulsed by hell,â€ and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning
flashes and thunderclaps, but â€œwe will not be tha attention was
immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.

â€œYes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!â€ shouted
one man.

â€œHe is the enemy of mankind!â€ cried another. â€œAllow me to speak....â€
â€œGentlemen, you are crushing me!...â€





CHAPTER XXIII

At that moment Count RostopchÃ­n with his protruding chin and alert eyes,
wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered
the room, riosity. Pierre
stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From
what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger
threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow
nobility. He was answered by a voice which informed him of the
resolution just arrived at.

â€œGentlemen!â€ said the Emperor with a quivering voice.

There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that
Pierre distinctly heard the ple everything. He now
felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought
an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count MamÃ³nov was
furnishing a regiment, BezÃºkhov at once informed RostopchÃ­n that he
would give a thousand men and their maintenance.

Old RostÃ³v could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and
at once consented to PÃ©tyaâ€™s request and went himself to enter his name.

Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assd in the social hierarchy
the less are they free.

The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal
interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that
time but its historic results.

Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to
further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all
expectedâ€”neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those
who did the actual fighting.

Thfrom the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was
adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some
of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to
Toll, and others again to Alexander himselfâ€”pointing to notes, projects,
and letters which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these
hints at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are
advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had ant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our
Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian
soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuelâ€™s
plan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor
reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could
not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach SmolÃ©nsk, still less
could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and 
an acute angleâ€”we led the French on to SmolÃ©nsk. But we withdrew at an
acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies;
the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because
Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by BagratiÃ³n (who
would come under his command), and BagratiÃ³nâ€”being in command of the
second armyâ€”tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclayâ€™s
command as long as he could. BagratiÃreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.

At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed
the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary
for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in
general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow
the strength of the Russian army was trebled.

He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chiefâ€™s undivided
control of the army, aith the Minister (meaning
Barclay). For Godâ€™s sake send me somewhere else if only in command of
a regiment. I cannot stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans
that a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought
I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out
that I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not want to.â€

The swarm of BronnÃ­tskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further
embittered the relations th my
son! Satisfied, are you? Thatâ€™s all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts
me, it hurts. Iâ€™m old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then,
gloat over it! Gloat over it!â€

After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was
ill and did not leave his study.

Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the
old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit
Mademoiselle Bourienne either. TÃ­khon alonesion by Antichrist,
and though Julie (now Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya), who had resumed
correspondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.

â€œI write you in Russian, my good friend,â€ wrote Julie in her Frenchified
Russian, â€œbecause I have a detestation for all the French, and the
same for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in
Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.

â€œMy poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in would spend a night in the dining room.

On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his
first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had
dutifully asked his fatherâ€™s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself
to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old
prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the
Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrewâ€™s second letter, written near
VÃ­tebom the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin
and went himself.

â€œThey canâ€™t do anything... always make some muddle,â€ he muttered.

While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and
even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned
with quick steps, accompanied by Michael IvÃ¡novich, bringing the letter
and a plan. These he put down beside himâ€”not letting anyone read them at
dinner.

On moving nce peevishly. â€œYes... yes...â€
His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. â€œYes, he
writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?â€

Dessalles dropped his eyes.

â€œThe prince says nothing about that,â€ he remarked gently.

â€œDoesnâ€™t he? But I didnâ€™t invent it myself.â€

No one spoke for a long time.

â€œYes... yes... Well, Michael IvÃ¡novich,â€ he suddenly went on, raising
his head and pointing to the plan of the bn waiting to start for some time.â€





CHAPTER III

When Michael IvÃ¡novich returned to the study with the letter, the old
prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his
open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched
hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscriptâ€”his
â€œRemarksâ€ as he termed itâ€”which was to be transmitted to the Emperor
after his death.

When Michael IvÃ¡novich wening the letter. He wished
to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
thoughts came to him in bed. So he called TÃ­khon and went through the
rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.

He went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed
unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.
That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive
thoughts he had had when lying there. Itbolts? No, I told him about them.
No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary
talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in
my pocketâ€”canâ€™t remember....â€

â€œTÃ­khon, what did we talk about at dinner?â€

â€œAbout Prince Michael...â€

â€œBe quiet, quiet!â€ The prince slapped his hand on the table. â€œYes, I
know, Prince Andrewâ€™s letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said
something about VÃ­tebsk. Now Iâ


CHAPTER IV

Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas BolkÃ³nskiâ€™s estate, lay forty miles east
from SmolÃ©nsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.

The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to AlpÃ¡tych,
Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the
prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety,
though from Prince Andrewâ€™s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald
Hills might be dangerous, he respectfuthe clerk orders about the work to be done, AlpÃ¡tych, not
trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and
crossed himself three times.

â€œIf there is anything... come back, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych! For Christâ€™s sake
think of us!â€ cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the
enemy.

â€œWomen, women! Womenâ€™s fuss!â€ muttered AlpÃ¡tych to himself and started
on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the
still-greeirty years ago FerapÃ³ntov, by AlpÃ¡tychâ€™s advice, had bought a
wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an
inn, and a corn dealerâ€™s shop in that province. He was a stout, dark,
red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a
nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.

Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, FerapÃ³ntov was standing
before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing AlpÃ¡
about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town,
everybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm
one another.

In front of the Governorâ€™s house AlpÃ¡tych found a large number of
people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governorâ€™s. At the
porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an
ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:

â€œItâ€™s no joke, you know! Itâ€™s all very well if youâ€™anging on his neck to follow him, and vanished
again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions
addressed to him. AlpÃ¡tych moved forward and next time the official came
out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat,
and handed him two letters.

â€œTo his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince BolkÃ³nski,â€ he
announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned
to him and took the letters.

A fe you will see that
you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of SmolÃ©nsk, for
those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory.â€
(Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of
SmolÃ©nsk, 1812.)

People were anxiously roaming about the streets.

Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept
emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.
Loaded carts stood at the hous AlpÃ¡tych adjusted his
waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed AlpÃ¡tych into the
opposite room.

â€œGoing already?â€ said he.

AlpÃ¡tych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages
and asked how much he owed.

â€œWeâ€™ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governorâ€™s?â€ asked
FerapÃ³ntov. â€œWhat has been decided?â€

AlpÃ¡tych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.

â€œWith our business, how can we gecame whistling sounds and the thud of
cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds
were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the
town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was
being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered
up after four oâ€™clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of
this bombardment.

At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells onmething whistled, but this time quite close, swooping
downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the
street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.

â€œScoundrel, what are you doing?â€ shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the
cook.

At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different
sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently
with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowddiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in
different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them
ran into FerapÃ³ntovâ€™s yard before AlpÃ¡tychâ€™s eyes. AlpÃ¡tych went out
to the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the
street.

Noticing him, an officer said: â€œThe town is being abandoned. Get away,
get away!â€ and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:

â€œIâ€™ll teach you to run into the yards!â€

AlpÃ¡tychso that AlpÃ¡tych could not pass out and had to wait.
FerapÃ³ntovâ€™s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till
it was possible to drive out.

Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out
amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper
AlpÃ¡tychâ€™s cart and that of the innkeeperâ€™s wife, which were slowly
moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop.
In a side street near the crasked.

â€œYour... your excellency,â€ stammered AlpÃ¡tych and broke into sobs. â€œAre
we really lost? Master!...â€

â€œWhy are you here?â€ Prince Andrew repeated.

At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young masterâ€™s pale
worn face. AlpÃ¡tych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it
was to get away.

â€œAre we really quite lost, your excellency?â€ he asked again.

Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knays do obey exactly.... You must
please excuse me,â€ he went on apologetically.

Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and
wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another
terrible crash and something huge collapsed.

â€œOu-rou-rou!â€ yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof
of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all
around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, artillery and baggage
wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very
hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft,
choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. Some of this dust
was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a
cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and
worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that
road. The higher the sun roseto trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.

In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to
Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of SmolÃ©nsk on the sixth
of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended)
and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to
pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled.
But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to
thid had often
seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast
shoe.

He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on
the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of
bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.

Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had
been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of
the house among the rosebuWhat am I to say to him?â€ thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the
old manâ€™s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on
his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions
were and only asked them to allay his grief.

â€œYes, let them have it,â€ replied Prince Andrew.

â€œIf you noticed some disorder in the garden,â€ said AlpÃ¡tych, â€œit was
impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent
the night, ding to let them
see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened
little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible
desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him
when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other human
interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those
that occupied him. Evidently these girls passionately desired one
thingâ€”to carry away and eat those greeno a watering
can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered
it specially pathetic.

One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew
knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself,
stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another,
a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his
waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted
with satisfactld be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every
word in it to the best of his ability.)

I expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the
abandonment of SmolÃ©nsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and
the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been
wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently
and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear
to you on my honor that Napoleyet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I
am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear
that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the
Minister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and
desires the ruin of us all. So I write you frankly: call out the
militia. For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow
in a most masterly way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the
Imponaparte and had made constitutions and unmade
them again, but the salons of Anna PÃ¡vlovna and HÃ©lÃ¨ne remained just
as they had beenâ€”the one seven and the other five years before. At Anna
PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s they talked with perplexity of Bonaparteâ€™s successes just
as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the
European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was
to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of whichhe war in general was regarded as a series
of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the
view prevailed expressed by BilÃ­binâ€”who now in Petersburg was quite at
home in HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€™s house, which every clever man was obliged to visitâ€”that
not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be
settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasmâ€”news of which had reached
Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperorâ€™s returnâ€”was ridiculed
sot please the Emperor. They did
not listen to me.

â€œItâ€™s all this mania for opposition,â€ he went on. â€œAnd who for? It is
all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,â€
Prince VasÃ­li continued, forgetting for a moment that though at HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€™s
one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s one had to
be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. â€œNow, is
it suitable that Count KutÃºzov, the oldest em.

On the ninth of August Prince VasÃ­li at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s again met the
â€œman of great merit.â€ The latter was very attentive to Anna PÃ¡vlovna
because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational
establishments for young ladies. Prince VasÃ­li entered the room with the
air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.

â€œWell, have you heard the great news? Prince KutÃºzov is field marshal!
All dissensions are at an end! , when he said to
KutÃºzov: â€˜Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.â€™â€

â€œPerhaps the heart took no part in that speech,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

â€œOh, no, no!â€ warmly rejoined Prince VasÃ­li, who would not now yield
KutÃºzov to anyone; in his opinion KutÃºzov was not only admirable
himself, but was adored by everybody. â€œNo, thatâ€™s impossible,â€ said he,
â€œfor our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.â€

â€œGod grant only that Prans
who maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the
Russian commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards
all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur,
the law of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good
chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss
resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the
opening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there werlexanderâ€™s people, Moscow with its
     innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.â€


â€œWell?â€ asked Napoleon.

â€œOne of PlÃ¡tovâ€™s Cossacks says that PlÃ¡tovâ€™s corps is joining up with
the main army and that KutÃºzov has been appointed commander in chief. He
is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.â€

Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the
man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped
ofhim than RostÃ³vâ€™s, or a sergeant majorâ€™s with the
rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major
or Napoleon could deprive him of.

So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the
orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the
Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, LavrÃºshka screwed up
his eyes and considered.

In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning
in evng that this was done to perplex him and that
Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters
promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes
wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be
whipped. â€œAs soon as Napoleonâ€™s interpreter had spoken,â€ says Thiers,
â€œthe Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode
on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across
the ere
one of Russiaâ€™s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he
announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.

But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of
the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to BoguchÃ¡rovo and
thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her fatherâ€™s feverish and
sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to
leave him alone and for the first time in her liand domestics were moving
toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by
the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and
decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that
fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,
could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see
was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
of timidity and submission. On seeing hipinion.

He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no
hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do
to let him die on the road. â€œWould it not be better if the end did come,
the very end?â€ Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly
sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched
him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find
symptoms of the approach of the end. from
BoguchÃ¡rovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.

The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the
provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary
to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the
rural police having come to BoguchÃ¡rovo urged the same thing, saying
that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French
proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if ther new, liberated life
would be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward
morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.

She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her
clearly what chiefly concerned her about her fatherâ€™s illness. On waking
she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him
groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.

â€œBut what could have happened? What did I was left hand pressed hers
so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He
twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.

She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When
she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he
calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips
and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and
imploringly at her, evidentincess Mary, shaking her head.

Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as
he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move
with difficulty.

â€œDear one... Dearest...â€ Princess Mary could not quite make out what he
had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender
caressing word such as he had never used to her before. â€œWhy didnâ€™t you
come in?â€

â€œAnd I was wishing for his death!â€ tg of Russia,
or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and
so she could not guess his words.

â€œPut on your white dress. I like it,â€ was what he said.

Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor
taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to
persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the
prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the
Emld not enter.

â€œGo away, Princess! Go away... go away!â€

She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the
slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how
long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a womanâ€™s
footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw DunyÃ¡sha her maid,
who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in
alarm on seeing her mistress.

â€œPlease come, Princessile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!â€ And hiding
her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor,
who held her up.


In the presence of TÃ­khon and the doctor the women washed what had been
the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should
not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the
legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform
with his decorations anr the old prince called boorishness. Various
obscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that
they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to
which they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the
Tsarâ€™s and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which
it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had
stopped it), then of Peter FÃ«dorovichâ€™s return to the throne in d
hunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement
died down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason.
But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new
forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and
at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone
living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these
undercurrents were acting strongly and neariluggage from BoguchÃ¡rovo, there had been a village meeting at
which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no
time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old princeâ€™s death,
the Marshal had insisted on Princess Maryâ€™s leaving at once, as it was
becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he could
not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of the day the
old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to returntych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his
Dron on the day of the princeâ€™s funeral and told him to have twelve
horses got ready for the princessâ€™ carriages and eighteen carts for
the things to be removed from BoguchÃ¡rovo. Though the peasants paid
quitrent, AlpÃ¡tych thought no difficulty would be made about complying
with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty households at
work in BoguchÃ¡rovo and the peasants were well to do. Buith the enemy, and there is an order from the
Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you
hear?â€

â€œI hear,â€ Dron answered without lifting his eyes.

AlpÃ¡tych was not satisfied with this reply.

â€œEh, Dron, it will turn out badly!â€ he said, shaking his head.

â€œThe power is in your hands,â€ Dron rejoined sadly.

â€œEh, Dron, drop it!â€ AlpÃ¡tych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his
bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor aeside themselves, YÃ¡kov AlpÃ¡tych; theyâ€™ve fetched another
barrel.â€

â€œWell, then, listen! Iâ€™ll go to the police officer, and you tell them
so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.â€

â€œI understand.â€

AlpÃ¡tych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time
and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion
that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive â€œI understandâ€
from Dron, which had
shown itself during her fatherâ€™s illness. She wished to pray but did not
dare to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God.
She lay for a long time in that position.

The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays
shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco
cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts
suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her ha
sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but
this great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone,
and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess
heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and
listening to the sound of her voice.

â€œYour position is doubly terrible, dear princess,â€ said Mademoiselle
Bourienne after a pause. â€œI understand that you could not, and cannot,She handed this to the princess.

â€œI think it would be best to appeal to that general,â€ she continued,
â€œand I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.â€

Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled
sobs.

â€œFrom whom did you get this?â€ she asked.

â€œThey probably recognized that I am French, by my name,â€ replied
Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.

Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and wishe did not care where she remained or what
happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead
father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts
and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what they would
have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrewâ€™s
study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her
position.

The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her fa began, but could not go on.

â€œWe are all in Godâ€™s hands,â€ said he, with a sigh.

They were silent for a while.

â€œDrÃ³nushka, AlpÃ¡tych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn
to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I canâ€™t even go away?â€

â€œWhy shouldnâ€™t you go away, your excellency? You can go,â€ said Dron.

â€œI was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I
can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want She began asking Dron about the
peasantsâ€™ needs and what there was in BoguchÃ¡rovo that belonged to the
landlord.

â€œBut we have grain belonging to my brother?â€ she said.

â€œThe landlordâ€™s grain is all safe,â€ replied Dron proudly. â€œOur prince
did not order it to be sold.â€

â€œGive it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave
in my brotherâ€™s name,â€ said she.

Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.

â€œGive them that corn if ever ordered them to go away,â€ said
Princess Mary. â€œCall DrÃ³nushka.â€

Dron came and confirmed DunyÃ¡shaâ€™s words; the peasants had come by the
princessâ€™ order.

â€œBut I never sent for them,â€ declared the princess. â€œYou must have given
my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.â€

Dron only sighed in reply.

â€œIf you order it they will go away,â€ said he.

â€œNo, no. Iâ€™ll go out to them,â€ said Princess Mary, and in spd I beg you to take everything, all our grain,
so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been told that I am
giving you the grain to keep you hereâ€”that is not true. On the contrary,
I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow, and
I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing.
You shall be given food and lodging.â€

The princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.

â€œI am not doing this on myâ€™t agree.... We
are sorry for you, but weâ€™re not willing. Go away yourself, alone...â€
came from various sides of the crowd.

And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression,
though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude,
but of angry resolve.

â€œBut you canâ€™t have understood me,â€ said Princess Mary with a sad smile.
â€œWhy donâ€™t you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here
the enemy would ruin om behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to
rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.

Pictures of the near pastâ€”her fatherâ€™s illness and last momentsâ€”rose
one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered
over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the
picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in
imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these picturesat he said the day he died. While talking
to TÃ­khon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was
standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him
to talk to TÃ­khon who did not understand him. I remember how he began
speaking to him about Lise as if she were aliveâ€”he had forgotten she
was deadâ€”and TÃ­khon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted,
â€˜Fool!â€™ He was greatly depressed. From behind the door I heard how he
lay dohin it held her fast.

â€œDunyÃ¡sha,â€ she whispered. â€œDunyÃ¡sha!â€ she screamed wildly, and tearing
herself out of this silence she ran to the servantsâ€™ quarters to meet
her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.





CHAPTER XIII

On the seventeenth of August RostÃ³v and IlyÃ­n, accompanied by LavrÃºshka
who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left
their quarters at YankÃ³vo, ten miles from BoguchÃ¡rovo, and wehe barn, where a large crowd of peasants was
standing.

Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals
without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces
and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and
singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.

â€œFine fellows!â€ said RostÃ³v laughing. â€œIs there any hay here?â€

â€œAnd how like one another,â€ said IlyÃ­n.

â€œA mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-ohe respectfully, but with
a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand
thrust into his bosom. â€œMy mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince
Nicholas BolkÃ³nski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding
herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these peopleâ€â€”he
pointed to the peasantsâ€”â€œasks you to come up to the house.... Wonâ€™t
you, please, ride on a little farther,â€ said AlpÃ¡tych with a melancholy
smile, âor her journey, the peasants had
come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let
her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that
they would unharness the horses. AlpÃ¡tych had gone out to admonish them,
but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing
himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that
there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would
serve her as bent to move him to pity, looked at
him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in RostÃ³vâ€™s
eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that
radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.

â€œI cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here
and am able to show my readiness to serve you,â€ said RostÃ³v, rising. â€œGo
when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall ddotard!...â€ cried he. â€œWhat have you been
about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you canâ€™t manage them? Youâ€™re
a traitor yourself! I know you. Iâ€™ll flay you all alive!...â€ And as if
afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left AlpÃ¡tych and went rapidly
forward. AlpÃ¡tych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with
RostÃ³v at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said
the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would bturn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged
your lump of a son,â€ a little old man suddenly began attacking Dronâ€”â€œand
so they took my VÃ¡nka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to
die.â€

â€œTo be sure, we all have to die. Iâ€™m not against the commune,â€ said
Dron.

â€œThatâ€™s itâ€”not against it! Youâ€™ve filled your belly....â€

The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as RostÃ³v, followed by
IlyÃ­n, LavrÃºshka, and AlpÃ¡tych, came upen obediently came out of the crowd and began taking
off their belts.

â€œWhereâ€™s the Elder?â€ demanded RostÃ³v in a loud voice.

With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.

â€œAre you the Elder? Bind him, LavrÃºshka!â€ shouted RostÃ³v, as if that
order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.

And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own
belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.

â€œAnd you all listethings. Let it
all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put it under the
bast matting and cover it with hayâ€”thatâ€™s the way!â€

â€œEh, books, books!â€ said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrewâ€™s
library cupboards. â€œDonâ€™t catch up against it! Itâ€™s heavy, ladsâ€”solid
books.â€

â€œYes, they worked all day and didnâ€™t play!â€ remarked the tall,
round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the
dictionaries that were  obvious danger
to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and
noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind,
honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to
cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.

When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt
her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange
question presented itself to her: did shef the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew
angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle
Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune,
had against his will more than once entered his head. For himself
personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her
he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his
fatherâ€™s affairs in order, and would evenâ€”he felt itâ€”ensure Princess
Maryâ€ officers, replied:

â€œWhat? His Serene Highness? I expect heâ€™ll be here soon. What do you
want?â€

The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the
orderlyâ€™s tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and
approached BolkÃ³nski with a slight bow. BolkÃ³nski made room for him on
the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.

â€œYouâ€™re also waiting for the commander in chief?â€ said he. â€œThey say he
weceives evewhad received so many new and very serious
impressionsâ€”such as the retreat from SmolÃ©nsk, his visit to Bald Hills,
and the recent news of his fatherâ€™s deathâ€”and had experienced so many
emotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his
mind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their
former strength. For DenÃ­sov, too, the memories awakened by the name of
BolkÃ³nski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper aof honor) was standing, and they saw KutÃºzov coming down the
street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals
rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of
officers ran after and around them shouting, â€œHurrah!â€

His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. KutÃºzov was impatiently
urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he
raised his hand to his white Horse Guardâ€™s cap with a red band ane arms of the Cossacks and adjutants
who stood ready to assist him.

He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced
at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his
waddling gait to the porch. â€œWhew... whew... whew!â€ he whistled, and
again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was
only after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrewâ€™s
face linked itself up with KutÃºzovâ€™s remembghness a matter of great importance for their countryâ€™s welfare.
KutÃºzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of
annoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: â€œFor our
countryâ€™s welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!â€ DenÃ­sov blushed like a
girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous,
time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the
enemyâ€™s lines of communication between SmolÃ©nskto be signed.â€

An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness
within. But KutÃºzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he
was disengaged. He made a grimace....

â€œNo, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. Iâ€™ll look
at them here,â€ said he. â€œDonâ€™t go away,â€ he added, turning to Prince
Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the generalâ€™s report.

While this was being given, Prince Andrew heardver and to
the point, but it was evident that KutÃºzov despised knowledge
and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the
matterâ€”something independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince
Andrew watched the commander in chiefâ€™s face attentively, and the only
expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the
meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to
observe propriety. It was evident that KutÃºzov despisedshing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after
all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long
been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to KutÃºzov.

He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:

â€œAh, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!â€

He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the
dish for her. â€œWell, my dear, and how are we getting on?â€ he asked,
moving to the door ded Prince Andrew, â€œI have grown used to my regiment,
am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be
sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you,
believe me...â€

A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up KutÃºzovâ€™s podgy
face. He cut BolkÃ³nski short.

â€œI am sorry, for I need you. But youâ€™re right, youâ€™re right! Itâ€™s not
here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are
 more haste, less speed. KÃ¡menski would have
been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand
men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to
win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and
time are wanted. KÃ¡menski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed
these two things and took more fortresses than KÃ¡menski and made them
Turks eat horseflesh!â€ He swayed his head. â€œAnd the French shall t left the room KutÃºzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his
unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.

Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that
interview with KutÃºzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to
the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been
entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in
that old manâ€”in whom there seemed to remain only the habit o
remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe
that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English
Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything
for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had
displayed during the Emperorâ€™s stay was the call for contributions of
men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made
assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidabouts rimÃ©s.

In the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these
broadsheets, and some liked the way KarpÃºshka jeered at the French,
saying: â€œThey will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our
buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all
dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.â€
Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was
said that RostopchÃ­n had expelled all Frd â€œmon
chevalier,â€ and who was going with her to NÃ­zhni.

In Julieâ€™s set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed
that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a
slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary
Contributions.

â€œAnother forfeit for a Gallicism,â€ said a Russian writer who was
present. â€œâ€˜What pleasure is there to beâ€™ is not Russian!â€

â€œYou spare no one,â€ continued Julie to tafraid I
should hardly be able to climb onto a horse.â€

Among those whom Julieâ€™s guests happened to choose to gossip about were
the RostÃ³vs.

â€œI hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,â€ said Julie. â€œAnd he
is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The RazumÃ³vskis wanted
to buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He
asks too much.â€

â€œNo, I think the sale will come off in a few days,â€ said someone.
â€œThough it 

â€œWhat knights? What do you mean?â€ demanded Pierre, blushing.

â€œOh, come, my dear count! Câ€™est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous admire,
ma parole dâ€™honneur!â€ *

    * â€œIt is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!â€


â€œForfeit, forfeit!â€ cried the militia officer.

â€œAll right, one canâ€™t talkâ€”how tiresome!â€

â€œWhat is â€˜the talk of all Moscowâ€™?â€ Pierre asked angrily, rising to his
feet.

â€œCome now, Count, you know!â€€

â€œDo you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune
homme.â€ *

    * â€œA little bit in love with the young man.â€


â€œForfeit, forfeit, forfeit!â€

â€œBut how could one say that in Russian?â€





CHAPTER XVIII

When Pierre returned home he was handed two of RostopchÃ­nâ€™s broadsheets
that had been brought that day.

The first declared that the report that Count RostopchÃ­n had forbidden
people to leave Moscow was false; o mean that I must go to the army,â€ said Pierre to himself.
â€œCome in, come in!â€ he added to the princess.

Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist,
was still living in Pierreâ€™s house. The two younger ones had both
married.

â€œExcuse my coming to you, cousin,â€ she said in a reproachful and
agitated voice. â€œYou know some decision must be come to. What is going
to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How i it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.â€

â€œOh, that count of yours!â€ said the princess malevolently. â€œHe is a
hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didnâ€™t
he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, â€˜whoever it might be,
should be dragged to the lockup by his hairâ€™? (How silly!) â€˜And honor
and glory to whoever captures him,â€™ he says. This is what his cajolery
has brought us to! Barbara IvÃ¡novna told me the mob near klearned that it was being constructed by the Emperorâ€™s
desire. The Emperor had written to Count RostopchÃ­n as follows:

As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and
intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General KutÃºzov to let
him know. I have informed him of the matter.

Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for
the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemyâ€™s
hands. It is essenteems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his
teeth on edge!â€ said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre,
when the Frenchman began to cry.

The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be
appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in
dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.

Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back
to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, anºshkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that
evening. (This was the battle of ShevÃ¡rdino.) He was told that there in
PerkhÃºshkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer
his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching
MozhÃ¡ysk.

Every house in MozhÃ¡ysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel
where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be
had. It was full of officers.

Eves not the least
sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result
for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer
to the destruction of Moscowâ€”which we feared more than anything in
the world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were
brought nearer to the destruction of their whole armyâ€”which they feared
more than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite
obvious, and yet Napoleon offered mpaign by
occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleonâ€™s
historians themselves tell us that from SmolÃ©nsk onwards he wished
to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the
occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had
seen at SmolÃ©nsk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and
had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his
wish to negotiate.

In giving and accepti
the field of BorodinÃ³.

So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to
look into the matter can easily convince himself.

The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,
during the retreat passed many positions better than BorodinÃ³. They did
not stop at any one of these positions because KutÃºzov did not wish to
occupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand
for a battle had not yet expressed fact that up to
the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and BagratiÃ³n were convinced that the
ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that KutÃºzov
himself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of
the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much
later, when reports on the battle of BorodinÃ³ were written at leisure,
that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to
justify the mistakes he KolochÃ¡. And the Russians, not having
time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the
position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which
had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other
side of the KolochÃ¡ to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the
whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian
side) and transferred it to the plain between UtÃ­tsa, SemÃ«novsk, and
BorodinÃ³e it chanced to
be.

Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,
unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was
increased by the fact that the Russian commandersâ€”not having fully
realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left
flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from
right to leftâ€”maintained their extended position from the village of
NÃ³voe to UtÃ­tsa, and conseqroceeded on
foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by
its singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who
had been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers,
shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The
carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying
or sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep
incline to make it something like a r the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men
were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had
probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags
and one cheek was swollen to the size of a babyâ€™s head. His nose
and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the
cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired
recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looservice, who all looked with astonishment at his white
hat and green tail coat.

Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and
eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was
driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon,
and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driverâ€™s
seat to pull up.

â€œCount! Your excellency, how come you to be here?â€ asked the doctor.

â€œWell, you kn of men, young and old, who
had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had
noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death
amazed Pierre.

â€œThey may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?â€
And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the MozhÃ¡ysk hill,
the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the
sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.
he battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots
and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward
the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed
Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment
than anything he had yet seen or heard.





CHAPTER XXI

Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen,
ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield
could beeither the left nor the
right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere
could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields,
meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and
streams; and try as he would he could descry no military â€œpositionâ€ in
this place which teemed with life, nor could he even distinguish our
troops from the enemyâ€™s.

â€œI must ask someone who knows,â€ he thought, and addressed an offin tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our
entrenchments. There, you see? Thereâ€™s our center, at BorodinÃ³, just
there,â€ and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white
church. â€œThatâ€™s where one crosses the KolochÃ¡. You see down there where
the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, thereâ€™s the bridge. Thatâ€™s our
center. Our right flank is over thereâ€â€”he pointed sharply to the right,
far away in the broken groundâ€”â€œThahe ran past the men at work.

â€œThere they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... Theyâ€™ll be
here in a minute...â€ voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers,
soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.

A church procession was coming up the hill from BorodinÃ³. First along
the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms
reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.

Soldiers and militiamen raneâ€™s Cross on his neck
stood just behind the priestâ€™s back, and without crossing himself (he
was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which
he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the
patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial
pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest
while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre
recognized several acquaintanceite head and puffy face showing the white ball of the
eye he had lost, KutÃºzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into
the crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an
accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and
bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind KutÃºzov was Bennigsen and
the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted
the attention of all the superior officers, the militiamen and soldied
some thirty paces from KutÃºzov, talking to BorÃ­s.

He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
position.

â€œThis is what you must do,â€ said BorÃ­s. â€œI will do the honors of the
camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen
will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; Iâ€™ll mention it to him.
But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us. We are
just going to the left flank. Then when we get bactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.â€

Though KutÃºzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, BorÃ­s
had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had
established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom BorÃ­s
had been in attendance, considered young Prince DrubetskÃ³y an invaluable
man.

In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: KutÃºzovâ€™s
party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. BorÃ­s bd Pierre.

â€œHeâ€™s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!â€ was the answer. â€œHe
has been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. Heâ€™s been
proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemyâ€™s picket
line at night.... Heâ€™s a brave fellow.â€

Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to KutÃºzov.

â€œI concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send
me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I sl? My quarters are at your service.â€

And as often happens with old people, KutÃºzov began looking about
absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.

Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew
KaysÃ¡rov, his adjutantâ€™s brother.

â€œThose verses... those verses of MÃ¡rinâ€™s... how do they go, eh? Those he
wrote about GerÃ¡kov: â€˜Lectures for the corps inditingâ€™... Recite them,
recite them!â€ said he, evidently preparince turned to the left, passing an enormous number of
troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging.
This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as
the RaÃ©vski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special
attention to it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to
him than any other spot on the plain of BorodinÃ³.

They then crossed the hollow to SemÃ«novsk, where the soldiers were
dragging awairch wood. In the middle of the
wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of
the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front
of them for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only
when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear
in the thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half
they came out on a glade where troops of TÃºchkovâ€™s corps were stationed
ton chief.





CHAPTER XXIV

On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his
elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of KnyazkÃ³vo at the further
end of his regimentâ€™s encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he
could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches
with their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of
oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of
campfiresâ€”the soldiersât of his clear perception of death. â€œThere they are, those
rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious.
Glory, the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itselfâ€”how
important these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they
seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the
cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.â€ The
three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particuut which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist....â€

He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their
motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. â€œTo die... to be
killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still
be, but no me....â€

And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the
smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed
terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran doeated that word
â€œinteresting.â€ â€œI wish to see the battle.â€

â€œOh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they
stop it?â€ said Prince Andrew sarcastically. â€œWell, and howâ€™s Moscow? And
my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?â€ he asked seriously.

â€œYes, they have. Julie DrubetskÃ¡ya told me so. I went to see them, but
missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.â€





CHAPTER XXV

The officers were aboutght again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your
excellency,â€ said TimÃ³khin timidly, and continually turning to glance at
his colonel.

â€œWhy so?â€ asked Pierre.

â€œWell, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when
we were retreating from SventsyÃ¡ni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp
of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all;
wasnâ€™t it so, your excellency?â€ and again TimÃ³khin turned to the prince.ur
father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your
fatherâ€™s requirements better than you could, then itâ€™s all right to let
him serve. But if your father is mortally sick youâ€™ll send the valet
away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands,
and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could.
So it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could
serve her and be a splendid ministers made by the staff, I should be there making
arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in
the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrowâ€™s
battle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends,
and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers,
and least of all on position.â€

â€œBut on what then?â€

â€œOn the feeling that is in me and in him,â€ he pointed to TimÃ³khin, â€œand
in ePierre reproachfully.

â€œAt such a moment!â€ Prince Andrew repeated. â€œTo them it is only a moment
affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross
or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred
thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and
the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side
that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you
like I will tell no,â€ agreed the other.

â€œExtend widely!â€ said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had
ridden past. â€œIn that â€˜extendâ€™ were my father, son, and sister, at Bald
Hills. Thatâ€™s all the same to him! Thatâ€™s what I was saying to youâ€”those
German gentlemen wonâ€™t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all
the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but
theories not worth an empty eggshell and havenâ€™t in their hearts the r death calmly, and as
it were lightheartedly.

â€œNot take prisoners,â€ Prince Andrew continued: â€œThat by itself would
quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have
played at warâ€”thatâ€™s whatâ€™s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that
stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and
sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she
is so kindhearted that she canâ€™t look at blood, but enjoys eatwe ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to
accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in
that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is
now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military
calling is the most highly honored.

â€œBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the
habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war
are spying, treacherâ€ repeated Prince
Andrew.

He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. â€œGood-by, be
off!â€ he shouted. â€œWhether we meet again or not...â€ and turning away
hurriedly he entered the shed.

It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the
expression of Prince Andrewâ€™s face was angry or tender.

For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow
him or go away. â€œNo, he does not want it!â€ Pierre concluded. â€ich seemed to be fettered by her bodyâ€”it was that
soul I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily...â€ and suddenly
he remembered how his love had ended. â€œHe did not need anything of that
kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. He only saw in
her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite
his fate. And I?... and he is still alive and gay!â€

Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began
pacin the Emperor the number of
prisoners taken in yesterdayâ€™s action, was standing by the door after
delivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon,
frowning, looked at him from under his brows.

â€œNo prisoners!â€ said he, repeating the aide-de-campâ€™s words. â€œThey
are forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian
army.... Go on... harder, harder!â€ he muttered, hunching his back and
presenting his fat shoulders.

â€œAll riise, having placed something on the chairs and covered
it with a cloth.

De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the
old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,
presenting an envelope.

Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.

â€œYou have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?â€ he
asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial
tone.

â€œSire, all Paris regrets yothe Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for
some reason everyone called â€œThe King of Rome.â€

A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine
Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the
terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.

Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting
the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory
apparently seemed to Napoleoofficers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.

â€œVive lâ€™Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive lâ€™Empereur!â€ came those
ecstatic cries.

After breakfast Napoleon in de Beaussetâ€™s presence dictated his order of
the day to the army.

â€œShort and energetic!â€ he remarked when he had read over the
proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It
ran:

Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depands to his
generals.

The original line of the Russian forces along the river KolochÃ¡ had
been dislocated by the capture of the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt on the
twenty-fourth, and part of the lineâ€”the left flankâ€”had been drawn back.
That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground
was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone,
military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It would
seem that not much considerationshould be placed.

After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the
dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.

These dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm
and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:

At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the
plain occupied by the Prince dâ€™EckmÃ¼hl will open fire on the opposing
batteries of the enemy.

At the same k
commence on the right wing.

The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges,
advancing to the same heights as Morandâ€™s and Gibrardâ€™s divisions, which
under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into
line with the rest of the forces.

All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et
mÃ©thode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.

The Imperial Camp near MozhÃ¡ysk,

September, 6, 1812.
y the village (BorodinÃ³)
and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as
Morandâ€™s and GÃ©rardâ€™s divisions (for whose movements no directions are
given), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt
and come into line with the rest of the forces.

As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible
sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders
given him, he was to advance from the left throuians who believe that Russia was shaped
by the will of one manâ€”Peter the Greatâ€”and that France from a republic
became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one
manâ€”Napoleonâ€”to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a
bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.

If it had depended on Napoleonâ€™s will to fight or not to fight the
battle of BorodinÃ³, and if this or that other arrangement depended onill, though he ordered the
commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done
because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human
dignityâ€”which tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not less
a man than the great Napoleonâ€”demands the acceptance of that solution of
the question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.

At the battle of BorodinÃ³ Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.
That was all done by the  people killed one
another was not decided by Napoleonâ€™s will but occurred independently of
him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took
part in the common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took
place by his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a
cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the
transport soldiers.

Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was
the cause the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not
contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of
battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his
role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.





CHAPTER XXIX

On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:

â€œThe chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!â€

Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he bebt, sire,â€ replied Rapp.

Napoleon looked at him.

â€œDo you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at SmolÃ©nsk?â€
continued Rapp. â€œThe wine is drawn and must be drunk.â€

Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his
hand.

â€œThis poor army!â€ he suddenly remarked. â€œIt has diminished greatly since
SmolÃ©nsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so
and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guard adjust it by fumbling, and that
blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.â€

And having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,
Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.

â€œDo you know, Rapp, what military art is?â€ asked he. â€œIt is the art of
being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. Thatâ€™s all.â€

Rapp made no reply.

â€œTomorrow we shall have to deal with KutÃºzov!â€ said Napoleon. â€œWe shallage of ShevÃ¡rdino.

It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in
the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the
faint morning light.

On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in
the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report
shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the
right.

The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before oes standing before the hut. The
roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a
Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.

â€œItâ€™s time, Count; itâ€™s time!â€ cried the adjutant.

Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the
street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the
day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the
staff could be heard conversing in French, and KutÃºzovâto
become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored
and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist,
and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning
sun were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from
the dew, and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the
riverbanks and in BorodinÃ³. A white church could be seen through the
mist, and here and there the roofs of huts ie smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods,
fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over
fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were continually appearing
followed by their solemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and
woods, there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time
to become balls, but had their little echoes in just the same way.
â€œTrakh-ta-ta-takh!â€ came the frequent crackle of muskom the knoll.





CHAPTER XXXI

Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping
turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped
in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass
either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers
everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with
some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same
dissatisfiouted somebody at him again.

â€œTo the left!... Keep to the right!â€ the men shouted to him.

Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of RaÃ©vskiâ€™s
adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently
also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.

â€œHow have you got here?â€ he said, and galloped on.

Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of
getting in someoneâ€™s way again,d jolted him at every step.

â€œYou donâ€™t seem to be used to riding, Count?â€ remarked the adjutant.

â€œNo itâ€™s not that, but her action seems so jerky,â€ said Pierre in a
puzzled tone.

â€œWhy... sheâ€™s wounded!â€ said the adjutant. â€œIn the off foreleg above the
knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of
fire!â€

Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery
which had been moved forward and was in ading
that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches
had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most
important point of the battle.

On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one
of the least significant parts of the field.

Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench
surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with
an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionallylope of the trench
with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up
and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard,
their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a
kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs,
cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the
regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him,
gave him a nickname (â€œour gentlemanâ€), whole
attention was engrossed by watching the family circleâ€”separated from all
elseâ€”formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of
joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield
was now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier
lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he
observed the faces of those around him.

By ten oâ€™clock some twenty men had already been carried away  ball that struck a cannon wheel and a manâ€™s
leg.

â€œNow then, you foxes!â€ said another, laughing at some militiamen who,
stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.

â€œSo this gruel isnâ€™t to your taste? Oh, you crows! Youâ€™re scared!â€ they
shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg
had been torn off.

â€œThere, lads... oh, oh!â€ they mimicked the peasants, â€œthey donâ€™t like it
at all!â€

Pierre nond kept glancing uneasily around.

The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their
long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few
minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from
that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the
battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed. Around
the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any
longer took notice ofy which he was
standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes
and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were
entering the battery ran back.

â€œAll with grapeshot!â€ shouted the officer.

The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed
him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of
some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.

â€œThe scoundrels! What are th behind it, galloped past, while
another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and
piercing cries.





CHAPTER XXXII

Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery,
as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.

On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something
there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no
time to realize who these men were. He saw the senhman was about to say something, when just above their
heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre
that the French officerâ€™s head had been torn off, so swiftly had he
ducked it.

Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought
as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery
and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who,
it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But bef, now they will be horrified at what they have
done!â€ he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers
moving from the battlefield.

But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and
especially to the left, near SemÃ«novsk, something seemed to be seething
in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but
even increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks
with all his remaining strength.
ed into that hollow, the smoke
of the guns and musketry on the flÃ¨ches grew so dense that it covered
the whole approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could
be caught of something blackâ€”probably menâ€”and at times the glint of
bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were
French or Russian, could not be discovered from the ShevÃ¡rdino Redoubt.

The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into
Napoleonâ€eld adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his
marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress
of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was
impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given
moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place
of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also
because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon
circn to
fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even
their orders, like Napoleonâ€™s, were seldom carried out, and then but
partially. For the most part things happened contrary to their orders.
Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers
ordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians
unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward,
and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of them
under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them
back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death
they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance
promptings of the throng.





CHAPTER XXXIV

Napoleonâ€™s generalsâ€”Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that region of
fire and sometimes even entered itâ€”repeatedly led into it huge masses of
well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always happene look at a general with a suite, who
was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard.
Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in
a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending
reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the
Emperor would give another division.

Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and ein sending Friantâ€™s division instead of
ClaparÃ¨deâ€™s, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping
ClaparÃ¨de and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly.
Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing
the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicinesâ€”a role he so justly
understood and condemned.

Friantâ€™s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke
of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continuergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that
he was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the
enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedlandâ€”yet the terrible
stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent.

All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the
concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break
the enemyâ€™s line, and a cavalry attack by â€œthe men of iron,â€ all balanced on such a strained
centerâ€”destroy him and his army.

When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in
which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon,
or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the
concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the
Russians still holding their groundâ€”a terrible feeling like a nightmare
took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidenteased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave
a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux
vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at SemÃ«novsk, and through the
smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They
were Russians.

The Russians stood in serried ranks behind SemÃ«novsk village and its
knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent
forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a con he
were not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in
something elseâ€”in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who
were reporting. By long years of military experience he knew, and with
the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to
direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he
knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a
commander in chief, nor the place where the troops ardinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to
wait before we rejoice.â€

But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.

When ScherbÃ­nin came galloping from the left flank with news that the
French had captured the flÃ¨ches and the village of SemÃ«novsk, KutÃºzov,
guessing by the sounds of the battle and by ScherbÃ­ninâ€™s looks that the
news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking ScherbÃ­ninâ€™s
arm, led him aside.

â€œGo, my dea eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.

Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached KutÃºzov with a
half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his
cap.

He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance
intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to
Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom
he was dealing with. â€œDer alte Herrâ€ (as in their own setflank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what
you donâ€™t know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform
him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,â€ said KutÃºzov
sternly.

All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of
the panting old general.

â€œThey are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army!
The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred
soil ofin chief, to avoid personal
responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.

And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains
throughout an army one and the same temper, known as â€œthe spirit of
the army,â€ and which constitutes the sinew of war, KutÃºzovâ€™s words, his
order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of
the army to the other.

It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the
farthest lillow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which
the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men
were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually
being dragged away and the wounded carried off.

With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not
yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred
paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same
mood, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! Sheâ€™ll fall.... Ah,
they donâ€™t see it!â€ came identical shouts from the ranks all along the
regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown
dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner
in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell
close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted
aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose od that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his
palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained
of the previous dayâ€™s thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with
weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle
of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the
tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and
waited. â€œHere it comes... this one is coming our way again!â€ he th a quite new,
envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke
that curled up from the rotating black ball. â€œI cannot, I do not wish to
die. I love lifeâ€”I love this grass, this earth, this air....â€ He thought
this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.

â€œItâ€™s shameful, sir!â€ he said to the adjutant. â€œWhat...â€

He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of
an explosion, a whistlot into
step.

â€œYour excellency! Eh, Prince!â€ said the trembling voice of TimÃ³khin, who
had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.

Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the
stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids
drooped.


The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the
wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of
three tents with flaps turned back, pitchionate love of life.
Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and
attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired
noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the
head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a
crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.

â€œWe kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed
the King himself!â€ cried he, looking around
sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted
him. All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked,
bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as
a few weeks previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled
the dirty pond beside the SmolÃ©nsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh,
the same chair Ã  canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with
horror, as by a presentiment.

There were  he cried angrily to the
dressers.

His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince
Andrewâ€™s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to
undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent
down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to
someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to
lose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of
his thigleg stained with clotted blood
and with the boot still on.

â€œOh! Oh, ooh!â€ he sobbed, like a woman.

The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew
from seeing his face, moved away.

â€œMy God! What is this? Why is he here?â€ said Prince Andrew to himself.

In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been
amputated, he recognized Anatole KurÃ¡gin. Men were supporting him in
their arms and offering him a glass of water, btoo late. I know it!â€





CHAPTER XXXVIII

The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,
together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty
generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the
consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an
unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the
killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of
mind. This hundred guns
had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they
still held their ground.

â€œOur fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,â€ said the
adjutant.

â€œThey want more!...â€ said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.

â€œSire?â€ asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.

â€œThey want more!â€ croaked Napoleon frowning. â€œLet them have it!â€

Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for
whicere he said he intended to devote his
leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote:

The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times:
it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and
security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.

It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the
beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out,
full of well-being and prospericountry couple,
every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs,
and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and
everywhere.

Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner
of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the
peoplesâ€™ welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by
the employment of power confer benefactions.

â€œOf four hundred thousand who crossed theousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and
various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the DavÃ½dov
family and to the crown serfsâ€”those fields and meadows where for
hundreds of years the peasants of BorodinÃ³, GÃ³rki, ShevÃ¡rdino, and
SemÃ«novsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the
dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space
of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and
unwed to control them, and
they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match,
though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though
they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood
and powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both
sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done
by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds
continued.

Anyon the Russians continued to
block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been
attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain. But the French
did not make that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only
have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have
been won. To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his
Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. It
could not be. Napoleon d without further effort
on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal
wound it had received at BorodinÃ³. The direct consequence of the battle
of BorodinÃ³ was Napoleonâ€™s senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat
along the old SmolÃ©nsk road, the destruction of the invading army of
five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on
which at BorodinÃ³ for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger
spirit had been laif
this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.

A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with
the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex
problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.

This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing
with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small,
and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute contineds no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions
drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some larger or
smaller unit as the subject of observationâ€”as criticism has every
right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be
arbitrarily selected.

Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the
differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and
attaining to the art of integrating themevery time there has been a revolution in any state there have been
great men,â€ says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time
conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the
conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of
a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my
watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring
church; but because the bells begin to ring whenkings, ministers, and generals, and
study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are
moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance
in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is
evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering
the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much
mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has
been devoted to der that
there was not a single battle. The French did not move. As a bleeding,
mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained inert in Moscow
for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back:
they made a dash for the KalÃºga road, and (after a victoryâ€”for at
MÃ¡lo-YaroslÃ¡vets the field of conflict again remained theirs) without
undertaking a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back
to SmolÃ©nsk, beyond SmolÃ©nsk, beyond thempossible not to retreat another
and a third dayâ€™s march, and at last, on the first of September when
the army drew near Moscowâ€”despite the strength of the feeling that had
arisen in all ranksâ€”the force of circumstances compelled it to retire
beyond Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, dayâ€™s march, and
abandoned Moscow to the enemy.

For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are
made by generalsâ€”as anyone of us sitting over im,
which constantly conflict with one another.

Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that KutÃºzov should
have moved his army to the KalÃºga road long before reaching FilÃ­, and
that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander
in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not
one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based
on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.

A commandesition of the enemyâ€™s army
differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these
inevitable conditions of a commander in chiefâ€™s actions describe to
us, for instance, the position of the army at FilÃ­ and assume that the
commander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide
whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army
less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had
that question been setone in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general
matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all
these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the
height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking
among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose
bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might
overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said
y. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that
to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless
commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the
battle would still not take place. It would not take place because the
commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but
in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after  it
earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow
must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must
be given.â€ To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to
resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to
which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince ProzorÃ³vski,
under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced
that he was destined to save Russia and that that wasutÃºzov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep
in a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at
the collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed
to pinch his neck. Those who entered went up one by one to the field
marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant
KaysÃ¡rov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing
KutÃºzov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and Kahis savory dinner. They waited for him from
four till six oâ€™clock and did not begin their deliberations all that
time but talked in low tones of other matters.

Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did KutÃºzov leave his corner and
draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been
placed there to light up his face.

Bennigsen opened the council with the question: â€œAre we to abandon
Russiaâ€™s ancient and sacred capital without a struggleced for and against that
project. ErmÃ³lov, DokhtÃºrov, and RaÃ©vski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether
feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital
or guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not
to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course
of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other
generals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of
Moscow, spoke of the dir very long to them all.

The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all
felt that there was no more to be said.

During one of these pauses KutÃºzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to
speak. They all looked at him.

â€œWell, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken
crockery,â€ said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. â€œGentlemen,
I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,â€ he a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow,
RostopchÃ­n, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that
event, acted in an altogether different manner from KutÃºzov.

After the battle of BorodinÃ³ the abandonment and burning of Moscow was
as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.

Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the
feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.

The same thinthat to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed
to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing
it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that
RostopchÃ­n had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had
committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the
rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had
remained intact and that during Napoleonâ€™s occupation the inhabitants
hadst glory of the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being
stopped by Count RostopchÃ­nâ€™s orders, had already in June moved with her
Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her SarÃ¡tov estate, with
a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparteâ€™s servant, was really,
simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia. But
Count RostopchÃ­n, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the
government offices removed; now distributed quit and like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable
eventâ€”the abandonment and burning of Moscowâ€”and tried with his puny hand
now to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him
along with it.





CHAPTER VI

HÃ©lÃ¨ne, having returned with the court from VÃ­lna to Petersburg, found
herself in a difficult position.

In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who
occupied one of the highest posts in the En those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door
on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude!
Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I
render account only to God and to my conscience,â€ she concluded, laying
her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to
heaven.

â€œBut for heavenâ€™s sake listen to me!â€

â€œMarry me, and I will be your slave!â€

â€œBut thatâ€™s impossnsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance,
for which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with
her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de
Jobert came to see HÃ©lÃ¨ne when she was alone, and after that often came
again.

    * Lay member of the Society of Jesus.

One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt
down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged
Frenciew the aim of every religion was merely
to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to
human desires. And with this aim, in one of her talks with her Father
Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the question, in how far was she
bound by her marriage?

They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.
The scent of flowers came in at the window. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was wearing a white
dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbÃ©, e bound by what a false religion laid upon me.â€

The director of her conscience was astounded at having the case
presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbusâ€™ egg. He was
delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupilâ€™s progress, but could
not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.

â€œLet us understand one another, Countess,â€ said he with a smile, and
began refuting his spiritual daughterâ€™s arguments.





CHAPTER nteresting HÃ©lÃ¨ne was in doubt which of the two men she should marry.
The question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was
the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There
were, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of
such a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament
of marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent,
while the majority were interested in HÃ©lÃ¨neâ hundred times, remarked to his
daughter whenever he chanced to see her:

â€œHÃ©lÃ¨ne, I have a word to say to you,â€ and he would lead her
aside, drawing her hand downward. â€œI have heard of certain projects
concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your fatherâ€™s
heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my
dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to say,â€ and
concealing his unvarying emotion he woulwould give my life for the happiness of them both.â€

BilÃ­bin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could
help in that difficulty.

â€œUne maÃ®tresse-femme! * Thatâ€™s what is called putting things squarely.
She would like to be married to all three at the same time,â€ thought he.

    * A masterly woman.

â€œBut tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?â€ BilÃ­bin asked,
his reputation being so well established that he did not feaid not sound quite clear,
into French which suited it better.

     * â€œOh, Mamma, donâ€™t talk nonsense! You donâ€™t understand
     anything. In my position I have obligations.â€


â€œBut, my dear....â€

â€œOh, Mamma, how is it you donâ€™t understand that the Holy Father, who has
the right to grant dispensations...â€

Just then the lady companion who lived with HÃ©lÃ¨ne came in to announce
that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.

â€œNinÃ³.





CHAPTER VIII

Toward the end of the battle of BorodinÃ³, Pierre, having run down
from RaÃ©vskiâ€™s battery a second time, made his way through a gully to
KnyazkÃ³vo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and
seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in
the crowds of soldiers.

The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly
from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that leasant odor of greasy viands mingled with
the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were
eating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.

â€œAnd who may you be?â€ one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently
meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: â€œIf you want to eat
weâ€™ll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest
man.â€

â€œI, I...â€ said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social
phalfway up the
hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the
town and was returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the
darkness by his white hat.

â€œYour excellency!â€ he said. â€œWhy, we were beginning to despair! How is
it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?â€

â€œOh, yes!â€ said Pierre.

The soldiers stopped.

â€œSo youâ€™ve found your folk?â€ said one of them. â€œWell, good-by, Peter
KirÃ­lychâ€”isnâ€™t it?â€ thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded
to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the
end...â€ thought he.

They, in Pierreâ€™s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the
battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before
the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out
clearly and sharply from everyone else.

â€œTo be a soldier, just a soldier!â€ thought Pierre as he fell asleep,
â€œto eis benefactor
was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite
distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the
possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,
firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they were
kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing to
speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his
legs grew cold and bare.

He felt ashamed, ream) is to be able in your soul to
unite the meaning of all. To unite all?â€ he asked himself. â€œNo, not
to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts
together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness
them!â€ he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these
words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the
question that tormented him.

â€œYes, one must harness, it is time to harness.â€

âd. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken
him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the
way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of
that of Prince Andrew.





CHAPTER X

On the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of
the city he was met by Count RostopchÃ­nâ€™s adjutant.

â€œWe have been looking for you everywhere,â€ said the adjutant. â€œThe count
wants to see yr
conversation.

â€œIf theyâ€™re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,
but as things are now one canâ€™t answer for anything.â€

â€œBut you see what he writes...â€ said another, pointing to a printed
sheet he held in his hand.

â€œThatâ€™s another matter. Thatâ€™s necessary for the people,â€ said the
first.

â€œWhat is it?â€ asked Pierre.

â€œOh, itâ€™s a fresh broadsheet.â€

Pierre took it and began reading.

His Serene Highness e adjutant smiling, â€œand was very much
upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with
him. By the by, Count,â€ he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a
smile, â€œwe heard that you have family troubles and that the countess,
your wife...â€

â€œI have heard nothing,â€ Pierre replied unconcernedly. â€œBut what have you
heard?â€

â€œOh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I
heard.â€

â€œBut what did you hear?â€ so
on till he reached VereshchÃ¡gin, a half educated tradesman, you know, â€˜a
pet of a trader,â€™â€ said the adjutant smiling. â€œThey asked him, â€˜Who gave
it you?â€™ And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could
only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to
some understanding. He replied: â€˜From no one; I made it up myself.â€™
They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: â€˜I made it
up myself.â€™ And so it was rtended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match
for him. Thatâ€™s the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop
here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God
Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other.
Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?
He found some scoundrel of a painter...â€





CHAPTER XI

In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned ou and donâ€™t wish you any harm andâ€”as
you are only half my ageâ€”I advise you, as a father would, to cease
all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as
possible.â€

â€œBut what did KlyucharÃ«v do wrong, Count?â€ asked Pierre.

â€œThat is for me to know, but not for you to ask,â€ shouted RostopchÃ­n.

â€œIf he is accused of circulating Napoleonâ€™s proclamation it is not
proved that he did so,â€ said Pierre without looking at Rostopchnd angry
than he had ever before shown himself.

When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had
come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel
of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners.
They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre
did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and
only answered them in order to get rid of these people. When leike the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck
her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to
get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join PÃ©tya, or to get
him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved
possible. PÃ©tya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless
he was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nicholas was
somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letasy
grew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such
happiness. The presence of SÃ³nya, of her beloved NatÃ¡sha, or even of
her husband irritated her. â€œWhat do I want with them? I want no one but
PÃ©tya,â€ she thought.

At the end of August the RostÃ³vs received another letter from Nicholas.
He wrote from the province of VorÃ³nezh where he had been sent to procure
remounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that
one sos and their possessions
out by the other gates. In spite of RostopchÃ­nâ€™s broadsheets, or because
of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory
rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed
to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had
been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave.
Some said there had been another battle after BorodinÃ³ at which the
French had been r from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders
at home about the preparations for their departure.

The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with
everything, was constantly in pursuit of PÃ©tya who was always running
away from her, and was jealous of NatÃ¡sha with whom he spent all his
time. SÃ³nya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting
things packed. But of late SÃ³nya had been particularly sad and silent.
Nicholasâ€™ lete he was at home, because he had left BÃ©laya TsÃ©rkov
where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to
Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because
NatÃ¡sha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. NatÃ¡sha was
gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of
the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also
happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoratiomy. SÃ³nya was in
the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. NatÃ¡sha
was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons,
and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and
holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which
she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.

NatÃ¡sha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and
several times that morning had tried to set to work, butspeaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.
NatÃ¡sha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her
handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.

â€œThen you have nobody in Moscow?â€ she was saying. â€œYou would be more
comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family
are leaving.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know if it would be allowed,â€ replied the officer in a weak
voice. â€œHere is our commanding officer... ask though,â€ said MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna.

â€œNever mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move
into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.â€

â€œThere now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we
put them into the wing, the menâ€™s room, or the nurseâ€™s room, we must ask
permission.â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™ll ask.â€

NatÃ¡sha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door
into the sitting room, whg returned home told them the news he had heard.
He said the people had been getting arms in the KrÃ©mlin, and that though
RostopchÃ­nâ€™s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three
days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone
to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big
battle there.

The countess looked with timid horror at her sonâ€™s eager, excited face
as he said this. She realized that if sheg to work, kept passing from the yard to the
house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying
people, and flurrying them still more. PÃ©tya directed things in the
yard. SÃ³nya, owing to the countâ€™s contradictory orders, lost her head
and did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house
and yard, shouting and disputing. NatÃ¡sha, with the ardor characteristic
of all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in
thethe carpets,â€ she said,
referring to the Saxony china dishes.

â€œDonâ€™t, NatÃ¡sha! Leave it alone! Weâ€™ll get it all packed,â€ urged SÃ³nya
reproachfully.

â€œWhat a young lady she is!â€ remarked the major-domo.

But NatÃ¡sha would not give in. She turned everything out and began
quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and
unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had
been taken out of the cases, they recommenced 
But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not
get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count,
having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.

SÃ³nya and NatÃ¡sha slept in the sitting room without undressing.

That night another wounded man was driven down the PovarskÃ¡ya, and MÃ¡vra
KuzmÃ­nichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the
RostÃ³vsâ€™ yard. MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna concluded that he  man was Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski.





CHAPTER XV

Moscowâ€™s last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.
The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on
Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.

Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscowâ€”the rabble,
that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd
of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some offunded men dragged
themselves there from the RostÃ³vsâ€™ and from neighboring houses where
they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them
a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were
addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused,
saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these
wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one
cart there would be no reason to refusefore the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same
request on behalf of his master.

â€œOh, yes, yes, yes!â€ said the count hastily. â€œI shall be very pleased,
very pleased. VasÃ­lich, youâ€™ll see to it. Just unload one or two carts.
Well, what of it... do whatâ€™s necessary...â€ said the count, muttering
some indefinite order.

But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officerâ€™s
face had already sealed the order. The count looare
things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
them!... Really now, in our own yardâ€”we asked them in ourselves and
there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them
be taken... whereâ€™s the hurry?â€

The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters.
The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of
something detrimental to the childrenâ€™s interests, such as the building
of a -in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders
of VladÃ­mir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post
of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the
first division of the Second Army.

On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.

He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the
army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there.
So he considered it necessary to
from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly
restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,â€ he
went on rapidly. â€œGeneral Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at
the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a
hillside. You can imagine!â€

And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had
heard those days. NatÃ¡sha watched him with an intent gaze that confused
him, as if sâ€ said the count, and stopped.

â€œI was driving past YusÃºpovâ€™s house just now,â€ said Berg with a laugh,
â€œwhen the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldnâ€™t
buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a
small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear VÃ©ra wanted a
chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.â€ (At the mention
of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tÃ­lich told me. I consider...â€

â€œI consider,â€ NatÃ¡sha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to
PÃ©tya, â€œI consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I donâ€™t know what.
Are we despicable Germans?â€

Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and
letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed
headlong up the stairs.

Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful
attention of a now I donâ€™t understand about
it,â€ said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.

â€œThe eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,â€ muttered the count through
tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of
shame on his breast.

â€œPapa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...â€ asked NatÃ¡sha. â€œWe will still
take all the most necessary things.â€

The count nodded affirmatively, and NatÃ¡sha, at the rapid pace at which
she used to run when playinight before now lay about the yard, and still they went on
searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and
letting the wounded have another and yet another cart.

â€œWe can take four more men,â€ said the steward. â€œThey can have my trap,
or else what is to become of them?â€

â€œLet them have my wardrobe cart,â€ said the countess. â€œDunyÃ¡sha can go
with me in the carriage.â€

They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded meat?â€ she inquired, leaning out of the carriage
window.

â€œWhy, didnâ€™t you know, Miss?â€ replied the maid. â€œThe wounded prince: he
spent the night in our house and is going with us.â€

â€œBut who is it? Whatâ€™s his name?â€

â€œItâ€™s our intended that wasâ€”Prince BolkÃ³nski himself! They say he is
dying,â€ replied the maid with a sigh.

SÃ³nya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,
tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnat is it?â€ persisted NatÃ¡sha with
her quick intuition.

SÃ³nya sighed and made no reply. The count, PÃ©tya, Madame Schoss, MÃ¡vra
KuzmÃ­nichna, and VasÃ­lich came into the drawing room and, having closed
the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently
seated without looking at one another.

The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself
before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced
MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­ni on the box and did not so much as glance
round at what was going on behind him. From thirty yearsâ€™ experience
he knew it would be some time yet before the order, â€œBe off, in Godâ€™s
name!â€ would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said
he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch
something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again
be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg
him fo window and looked back and then forward at the long train of
wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see
the raised hood of Prince Andrewâ€™s calÃ¨che. She did not know who was
in it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that
calÃ¨che. She knew it was right in front.

In KÃºdrino, from the NikÃ­tski, PrÃ©snya, and PodnovÃ­nsk Streets came
several other trains of vehicles similar to the RostÃ³vsâ€™, and as they
passed aeardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a
face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully
touching Pierreâ€™s elbow said something to him and pointed to the
carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first
understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the
direction the old man indicated, he recognized NatÃ¡sha, and following
his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coe! I donâ€™t know myself. Tomorrow... But
no! Good-by, good-by!â€ he muttered. â€œItâ€™s an awful time!â€ and dropping
behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.

NatÃ¡sha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at
him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.





CHAPTER XVIII

For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living
in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, BazdÃ©ev. This is how it
hapof his study by the other door.
There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this
passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with
both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was
standing at the front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there
was a second staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that
staircase and out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were
some carriages waitingSophia DanÃ­lovna has gone to the
TorzhÃ³k estate with the children, your excellency.â€

â€œI will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,â€ said
Pierre.

â€œBe so good as to step in. MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich, the brother of my late
masterâ€”may the kingdom of heaven be hisâ€”has remained here, but he is in
a weak state as you know,â€ said the old servant.

Pierre knew that MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich was Joseph BazdÃ©evâ€™s half-insane
brother and a hard drink
More than two hours passed and GerÃ¡sim took the liberty of making a
slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not
hear him.

â€œIs the cabman to be discharged, your honor?â€

â€œOh yes!â€ said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. â€œLook
here,â€ he added, taking GerÃ¡sim by a button of his coat and looking down
at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, â€œI say, do you
know that there is going to be a battle tomorrol at the SÃºkharev market that he met the RostÃ³vs.





CHAPTER XIX

KutÃºzovâ€™s order to retreat through Moscow to the RyazÃ¡n road was issued
at night on the first of September.

The first troops started at once, and during the night they marched
slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing
the town at the DorogomÃ­lov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers
crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite sideThe brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the PoklÃ³nny
Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her
churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas
glittering like stars in the sunlight.

The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as
he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and
uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has
no knowledge o could it be otherwise?â€ he thought. â€œHere is this capital at my
feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,
beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what
light must I appear to them!â€ thought he, thinking of his troops.
â€œHere she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,â€ he reflected,
glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and
forming up. â€œOne word from me, one movement of  as I always do:
clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in
Moscow? Yes, there she lies.â€

â€œQuâ€™on mâ€™amÃ¨ne les boyars,â€ * said he to his suite.

    * â€œBring the boyars to me.â€


A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the
boyars.

Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the
same place on the PoklÃ³nny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to
the boyars had already takhe rear of his suite. Those sent to
fetch the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty,
that everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring
together were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact
that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact
seemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperorâ€”without putting
him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculousâ€”that he had been
awaiting the boby the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as
the DorogomÃ­lov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his
horse, paced for a long time by the KÃ¡mmer-KollÃ©zski rampart, awaiting
the deputation.





CHAPTER XX

Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a
fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty.
It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.

In a queenless hdanger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they
flew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower
part of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy beesâ€”tamed by
toil, clinging to one anotherâ€™s legs and drawing out the wax, with a
ceaseless hum of laborâ€”that used to hang in long clusters down to the
floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in
various directions on the floor and walls of the r, attack
some victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or
killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap
of corpses. The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine
the brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by
thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery
of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of
bees. They have almost all died unawares, sittim the wounded and the
last of the inhabitants who were leaving.

The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the
Stone, MoskvÃ¡, and YaÃºza bridges.

While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the
KrÃ©mlin, were thronging the MoskvÃ¡ and the Stone bridges, a great many
soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back
from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of
VasÃ­li the Beaat once, without fail.
This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.â€

â€œWhere are you off to?... Where?...â€ he shouted to three infantrymen
without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were
slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. â€œStop, you rascals!â€

â€œBut how are you going to stop them?â€ replied another officer. â€œThere is
no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt,
thatâ€™s all!â€

â€œHow can onein one. â€œIn my three shops here I have a
hundred thousand rublesâ€™ worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army
has gone? Eh, what people! â€˜Against Godâ€™s might our hands canâ€™t fight.â€™â€

â€œCome inside, your honor!â€ repeated the tradesman, bowing.

The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.

â€œItâ€™s not my business!â€ he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of
the passages.

From one open shop came the sound of blows and vir, upsetting carts, and shouting
and squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops
were now moving forward.





CHAPTER XXII

Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the
streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round
the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody
drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The
PovarskÃ¡ya was quite still and deserted. The a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.

Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go
nextâ€”to drink tea in the servantsâ€™ wing with VasÃ­lich, or into the
storeroom to put away what still lay about.

She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone
stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.
MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna went to the gate.

â€œWho do you want?â€

â€œThe countâ€”Couned and,
hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the
servantsâ€™ quarters.

While MÃ¡vra KuzmÃ­nichna was running to her room the officer walked about
the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint
smile on his lips. â€œWhat a pity Iâ€™ve missed Uncle! What a nice old
woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way
to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near the RogÃ³zhski
gate?â€ thought were singing discordantly, arduously, and with
great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because
they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall,
fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His
face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not
been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed
eyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were
singing, andlads!â€

At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised
face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: â€œPolice! Murder!...
Theyâ€™ve killed a man, lads!â€

â€œOh, gracious me, a man beaten to deathâ€”killed!...â€ screamed a woman
coming out of a gate close by.

A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.

â€œHavenâ€™t you robbed people enoughâ€”taking their last shirts?â€ said a
voice addressing the publican. â€œWhat have you killedquit of us. Heâ€™s been
misleading us all the week and now that heâ€™s brought us to this pass
heâ€™s made off.â€

On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased
speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving
crowd.

â€œWhere are all the folks going?â€

â€œWhy, to the police, of course!â€

â€œI say, is it true that we have been beaten?â€ â€œAnd what did you think?
Look what folks are saying.â€

Questions and answerd, but at the demand
of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather
tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.

â€œEarly tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,â€ he read (â€œSirin
Highness,â€ said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and
a frown on his brow), â€œto consult with him to act, and to aid the army
to exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part...â€ the reader
went on, and then paused (â€œDo d bearing down upon him told his coachman to
stop.

â€œWhat people are these?â€ he shouted to the men, who were moving singly
and timidly in the direction of his trap.

â€œWhat people are these?â€ he shouted again, receiving no answer.

â€œYour honor...â€ replied the shopman in the frieze coat, â€œyour honor, in
accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they
desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of
riot, but as 
patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and
unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this,
RostopchÃ­n had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa
without undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier
bringing him a letter from KutÃºzov. This letter requested the count to
send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army
was retreating to the RyazÃ¡n road beyond Moscow. Thileave the town empty,â€ explains Count RostopchÃ­n.
One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action
finds a justification.

All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for
public tranquillity.

On what, then, was Count RostopchÃ­nâ€™s fear for the tranquillity of
Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability
of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the
retreating tron a coarse tone which the
people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in
authority. RostopchÃ­n was so pleased with the fine role of leader of
popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of
relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display
took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under
his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew
it was coming, he did nd on.

When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note
from KutÃºzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself
to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state
property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no
longer possible to take the whole of it away.

â€œWho is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?â€ he
ruminated. â€œNot I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Mos Fire Brigade? They have
horses, let them be off to VladÃ­mir, and not leave them to the French.â€

â€œYour excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:
what are your commands?â€

â€œMy commands? Let them go away, thatâ€™s all.... And let the lunatics
out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means
these other madmen to be free.â€

In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count
RostopchÃ­n shouted angrilys own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer
reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead
of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant,
useless, feeble man.

RostopchÃ­n felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.

The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to
see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the
horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintean irrepressible fury that welled up
within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be
attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by
anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it. â€œHere is
that mob, the dregs of the people,â€ he thought as he gazed at the crowd:
â€œthis rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,â€
he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this
thought ocche spoke he saw a young man coming
round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin
neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by
short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat
lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict
trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots.
On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute
movements.

â€ly his face flushed.

All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more
hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly
and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.

â€œHe has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to
Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name,
he has caused Moscow to perish,â€ said RostopchÃ­n in a sharp, even voice,
but suddenly he glanced down aried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.

Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the
front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall
youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood
beside VereshchÃ¡gin.

â€œSaber him!â€ the dragoon officer almost whispered.

And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,
struck VereshchÃ¡gin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.g time, despite the feverish haste with
which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were
hitting, throttling, and tearing at VereshchÃ¡gin were unable to kill
him, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them
in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or
let him go.

â€œHit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ....
Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went
with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the
passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The countâ€™s face was
white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.

â€œThis way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,
please...â€ said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.

Count RostopchÃ­n was unable to reply and, turning obedientlyife and dignity as
commander in chief.â€

Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer
hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, RostopchÃ­n grew physically
calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil
his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The
thought which tranquillized RostopchÃ­n was not a new one. Since the
world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed
such a criier feel that the responsibility for all
the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the
ruin of Russia (as RostopchÃ­n regarded it) would fall upon his doting
old head. Planning beforehand what he would say to KutÃºzov, RostopchÃ­n
turned angrily in his calÃ¨che and gazed sternly from side to side.

The SokÃ³lniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the
almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white
and otachman. The calÃ¨che flew over the ground as
fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count RostopchÃ­n
still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the
distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened,
bloodstained face of â€œthe traitorâ€ in the fur-lined coat.

Recent as that mental picture was, RostopchÃ­n already felt that it had
cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that
the gory trace g to read something peculiar written at that moment on the
face of the man addressing him. RostopchÃ­n grew confused and became
silent. KutÃºzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating
gaze from RostopchÃ­nâ€™s face muttered softly:

â€œNo! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!â€

Whether KutÃºzov was thinking of something entirely different when
he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be
meaningless, at any rate Rostopm to ask where the Russian
army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several
voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer,
returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported
that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was
probably an ambuscade there.

â€œGood!â€ said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,
ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.
ed. The
guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks,
and an officer gave the word â€œFire!â€ This was followed by two whistling
sounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against
the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and two
wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.

A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the
stone-built KrÃ©mlin had died away the French heard a strange sounch entered
the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the
windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square
for fuel and kindled fires there.

Other detachments passed through the KrÃ©mlin and encamped along
the MorosÃ©yka, the LubyÃ¡nka, and PokrÃ³vka Streets. Others quartered
themselves along the VozdvÃ­zhenka, the NikÃ³lski, and the TverskÃ³y
Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were
not bicer was left. Men in military uniforms
and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and
walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were
busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open
coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading
and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening,
amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both
in the shops aowed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing
the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and
generals flocked there to select calÃ¨ches and coaches for themselves.
The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to
their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered.
There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around
the quarters occupied by the French were other regions stin the villages of any district and the number of fires in
that district immediately increases. How much then must the probability
of fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops
are quartered. â€œLe patriotisme fÃ©roce de RostopchÃ­neâ€ and the barbarity
of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by
the soldiersâ€™ pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of
enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not ows completely obsessed
by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had
taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past,
understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to
him like a dream.

He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifeâ€™s demands
that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable
to unravel. He had gone to Joseph AlexÃ©evichâ€™s house, on the plea of
sortidea that he, Lâ€™russe Besuhof, was destined to set a
limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that
often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.

When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among
the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the RostÃ³vs and
NatÃ¡sha had said to him: â€œAre you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!â€
the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thincontempt for
everything conventional, artificial, and humanâ€”for everything the
majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had
first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the SlobÃ³da
Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and lifeâ€”all that
men so painstakingly acquire and guardâ€”if it has any worth has so only
by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.

It was the feeling that induces a volunteer retered
Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about
his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his
fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the
blow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and
melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.

â€œYes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!â€ he thought.
â€œYes, I will approach... and then sudde heroic fancy in his head.

â€œTo arms! Board them! No, you shanâ€™t get it,â€ he yelled.

â€œThat will do, please, that will do. Have the goodnessâ€”please, sir, to
let go! Please, sir...â€ pleaded GerÃ¡sim, trying carefully to steer MakÃ¡r
AlexÃ©evich by the elbows back to the door.

â€œWho are you? Bonaparte!...â€ shouted MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich.

â€œThatâ€™s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to
have the pistol.â€

â€œBe off, thou bd
quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in
a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done
that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his
mustache and lightly touched his hat.

â€œBonjour, la compagnie!â€ * said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.

    * â€œGood day, everybody!â€


No one gave any reply.

â€œVous Ãªtes le bourgeois?â€ * the officer asked GerÃ¡sim.

    * â€œAr man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing
the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw
himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the
pistol MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there
was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The
Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.

Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,
snatching away the pist a Frenchman could
perform a great deed, and to save his lifeâ€”the life of M. Ramballe,
captain of the 13th Light Regimentâ€”was undoubtedly a very great deed.

But however indubitable that conclusion and the officerâ€™s conviction
based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.

â€œI am Russian,â€ he said quickly.

â€œTut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,â€ said the officer, waving his
finger before his nose and smiling. â€œYou shall tell me all about  answered the captain.





CHAPTER XXIX

When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again
thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to
go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite,
amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his
life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in
the parlorâ€”the first room they entered. To Pierreâ€™s assurances thbe so good as to tell me with whom I have
the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance
with that maniacâ€™s bullet in my body?â€

Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,
began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for
concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.

â€œOh, please!â€ said he. â€œI understand your reasons. You are an officer...
a superior officer perhaps. You haveo its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain
still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.

â€œYes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for
saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my
body already. Here is one I got at Wagramâ€ (he touched his side) â€œand a
second at SmolÃ©nskâ€â€”he showed a scar on his cheeably the word â€œgallantâ€ turned the captainâ€™s thoughts to the
state of Moscow.

â€œApropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left
Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?â€

â€œWould not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?â€
asked Pierre.

â€œHa, ha, ha!â€ The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting
Pierre on the shoulder. â€œWhat a thing to say!â€ he exclaimed. â€œParis?...
But Paris, Ps better
than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all
the worldâ€™s capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to
know. And then the Emperor...â€ he began, but Pierre interrupted him.

â€œThe Emperor,â€ Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and
embarrassed, â€œis the Emperor...?â€

â€œThe Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, geniusâ€”thatâ€™s
what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so....which he did not understand
said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the
quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to
occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German,
translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captainâ€™s
reply to the WÃ¼rttemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what
was said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The
captain went out into the porhtly and whistling a tune.

The Frenchmanâ€™s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled
him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which
he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. â€œI will go away
immediately. I wonâ€™t say another word to him,â€ thought Pierre. He
thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of
weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but
could not do so.

The casked Pierre.
â€œPerhaps itâ€™s the state of affairs?â€

Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchmanâ€™s eyes
whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.

â€œHonestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for
you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death.
I say it with my hand on my heart!â€ said he, striking his chest.

â€œThank you,â€ said Pierre.

The captain gazed intently at him as he had dy many of these, as one could easily believe, looking
at the officerâ€™s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager
enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballeâ€™s love
stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special
charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere
conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love
and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him witory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was
of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of
life continually occurred in the captainâ€™s stories) and the Pole had
entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de cÅ“ur) while himself
entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting
Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the
captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he dlish lady, the captain
asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice
himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.

Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to
express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he
understood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all
his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could
never be his.

â€œTiens!â everything and not left the city, but remained there
concealing his name and station.

When it was late at night they went out together into the street. The
night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the PokrÃ³vka a
fire glowedâ€”the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the
right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierreâ€™s
heart with his love. At the gate sn oâ€™clock that evening the RostÃ³v family and
the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and
huts of that large village. The RostÃ³vsâ€™ servants and coachmen and the
orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had
supper, fed the horses, and came out into the porches.

In a neighboring hut lay RaÃ©vskiâ€™s adjutant with a fractured wrist. The
awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his
moanlet (as he was called), came up to
the group and shouted at MÃ­shka.

â€œWhat are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be
calling and thereâ€™s nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.â€

â€œI only ran out to get some water,â€ said MÃ­shka.

â€œBut what do you think, Daniel TerÃ©ntich? Doesnâ€™t it look as if that
glow were in Moscow?â€ remarked one of the footmen.

Daniel TerÃ©ntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were easeless moaning of the adjutant, three
houses off.

â€œOh, how terrible,â€ said SÃ³nya returning from the yard chilled and
frightened. â€œI believe the whole of Moscow will burn, thereâ€™s an awful
glow! NatÃ¡sha, do look! You can see it from the window,â€ she said to her
cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.

But NatÃ¡sha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her
and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in
this lie down,â€ said
the countess.

â€œLie down? All right, I will. Iâ€™ll lie down at once,â€ said NatÃ¡sha.

When NatÃ¡sha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously
wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many
questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And
could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see
him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger,
sy pet,â€ said the countess, softly
touching NatÃ¡shaâ€™s shoulders. â€œCome, lie down.â€

â€œOh, yes... Iâ€™ll lie down at once,â€ said NatÃ¡sha, and began hurriedly
undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.

When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat
down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the
floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front,
and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, tÃ¡sha heard her motherâ€™s even breathing. NatÃ¡sha did
not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt,
was growing cold on the bare floor.

As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a
crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near
by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the
adjutant was heard. NatÃ¡sha sat up.

â€œSÃ³nya, are you asleep? Mamma?â€ she whispered.

No one rntâ€™s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her
imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an
indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the
quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood
still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She
cautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the
middle of a small room containing baggage. Another manâ€”TimÃ³khinâ€”was
lyiny he ate with
pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his
temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.
The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had
remained in the calÃ¨che, but at MytÃ­shchi the wounded man himself asked
to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into
the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he
had been placed on his camp bedhe wanted a bolster placed under him as he was
uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak
with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of
mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful
place. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a
change in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned
again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept askin
which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts,
and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete
stillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket
chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in
the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on
the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the
candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shasequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew
heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a
soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating
â€œpiti-piti-piti,â€ and then â€œtiti,â€ and then again â€œpiti-piti-piti,â€ and
â€œti-tiâ€ once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above
the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out
of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispereain quite clearly. â€œBut not love which loves
for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason,
but the love which Iâ€”while dyingâ€”first experienced when I saw my enemy
and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very
essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel
that bliss. To love oneâ€™s neighbors, to love oneâ€™s enemies, to love
everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to there was a whiff of fresh air, and
a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had
the pale face and shining eyes of the very NatÃ¡sha of whom he had just
been thinking.

â€œOh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,â€ thought Prince Andrew,
trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained
before him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew
wished to return to that former world of pure thought, but he e do-ne!â€ faltered NatÃ¡sha in a scarcely
audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just
touching it with her lips.

â€œI love you more, better than before,â€ said Prince Andrew, lifting her
face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.

Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,
compassionately, and with joyous love. NatÃ¡shaâ€™s thin pale face, with
its swollen lips, was more than plainâ€”it was dreadful. But Prince Andre Andrewâ€”spoke of
this: the unsettled question of life and death, which hung not only over
BolkÃ³nski but over all Russia, shut out all other considerations.





CHAPTER XXXIII

On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the
clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on
his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful
he had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterdayâ€™s
cstol,
and hid it under his waistcoat.

Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,
Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting
the captain, and passed out into the street.

The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the
evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on
fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river,
in the Bazaar and the Povaf the manâ€™s musket as
he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side
of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around
him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like
something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous nightâ€™s
experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring
his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by
anything on the , Pierre suddenly heard the
desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening
from a dream and lifted his head.

By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household
goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the
ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,
prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman,
swaying to and fro and muttering something, was chokin
â€œYou have no heart, you donâ€™t feel for your own child! Another man would
have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a
man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,â€ she went on,
addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. â€œThe fire broke out
alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out â€˜Fire!â€™ and we rushed
to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we
have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry be
â€œThis way, uncle,â€ cried the girl. â€œWeâ€™ll pass through the side street,
by the NikÃºlinsâ€™!â€

Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her.
She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and,
passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.

â€œItâ€™s here, close by,â€ said she and, running across the yard, opened a
gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden
wing of the house,ere dense
sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along
the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced
on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a
peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt
himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt
young, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of
the lodge and was about to dash into tou others!â€ he called out to his comrades. â€œItâ€™s getting
hot.â€

When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled
Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a
three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.

â€œThere is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!â€ said the
Frenchman. â€œGood-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you
know!â€ and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to. Pierre took no notice
of them. He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to
restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre
felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the
heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever
the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him
when he ran to save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging
with her little hands to out him.

With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than
before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.

â€œHave you lost anyone, my dear fellow? Youâ€™re of the gentry yourself,
arenâ€™t you? Whose child is it?â€ they asked him.

Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who
had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether
anyone knew where she had gone.

â€œWhy, that mustoted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and,
saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old
man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in the frieze gown
stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in
his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.

â€œHere, take the child!â€ said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the
woman, handing the little girl to her. â€œGive her back to them, gas in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and
his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman
and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his
feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard
from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French
Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to
Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre rememberâ€”take me!â€ Pierre
suddenly replied in French.

â€œAh, ah!â€ muttered the officer with a frown. â€œWell then, march!â€

A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the
pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol
started she moved forward.

â€œWhere are they taking you to, you poor dear?â€ said she. â€œAnd the little
girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if sheâ€™s not theirs?â€
said the woman.

â€œWhatÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna, the TsarÃ©vich, and others,
drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm,
luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and
reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made it hard,
except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the difficult
position of the Russian people. There were the same receptions and
balls, the same French theater, the same court interests and service
interests and intrigues as nder murmur, so that the wail fell
quite at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading,
as was always the case at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s soirees, had a political
significance. That evening she expected several important personages who
had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused
to a patriotic temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna
PÃ¡vlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room,
did not he most charming woman in the world,â€ she
went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. â€œWe belong to different
camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She
is very unfortunate!â€ added Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

Supposing that by these words Anna PÃ¡vlovna was somewhat lifting the
veil from the secret of the countessâ€™ malady, an unwary young man
ventured to express surprise that well-known doctors had not been called
in and that the countess wassed surprise. He knew no
more than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career
he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very
witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words
that entered his head. â€œIt may turn out very well,â€ he thought, â€œbut
if not, theyâ€™ll know how to arrange matters.â€ And really, during the
awkward silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic person
entered whom Anna rvant of God and
zealous champion of old of our countryâ€™s weal, is offered to Your
Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing
in the sight of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to
Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully
fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.â€

â€œWhat force! What a style!â€ was uttered in approval both of reader and
of author.

Animated by that address Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™sand far from the
scene of action. General events involuntarily group themselves around
some particular incident. So now the courtiersâ€™ pleasure was based as
much on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperorâ€™s birthday as
on the fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged
surprise. Mention was made in KutÃºzovâ€™s report of the Russian losses,
among which figured the names of TÃºchkov, BagratiÃ³n, and KutÃ¡ysov. In
the Petersburg world thSpain had
prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect;
but HÃ©lÃ¨ne, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and
that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate
Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the
drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her.
It was said that Prince VasÃ­li and the old count had turned upon the
Italian, but the latter had produced such lethall follow the army. I have
had everything removed, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate
of my fatherland.

On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince VolkÃ³nski to KutÃºzov
with the following rescript:

Prince Michael IlariÃ³novich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have
received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I
received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via YaroslÃ¡vl, the sad
news that you, with the army, have ith a sigh. â€œThe
abandonment of Moscow.â€

â€œHave they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?â€ asked the
Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.

Michaud respectfully delivered the message KutÃºzov had entrusted to him,
which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that
as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as
Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the
latter.

The EmperorI left the
whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in
desperate and agonized terror...â€

â€œHow is that?â€ the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. â€œWould
misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!â€

Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had
prepared.

â€œSire,â€ he said, with respectful playfulness, â€œthey are only afraid lest
Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourselfed voice the Emperor suddenly
turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,
and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few
moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow
with a vigorous movement. The Emperorâ€™s mild and handsome face was
flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.

â€œColonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may
recall it with pleasure someday..se we see only the general historic
interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests
that people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment
so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the
public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at
that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were
guided only by their private interests, and they were the very people
whose activitiere was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight
of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they
thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of MatrÃ«shka the
vivandiÃ¨re, and like matters.

As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas RostÃ³v took a close
and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually,
without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was
going on in Russiaere cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in
them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time. What for
a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young
and healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women,
too, who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke
with them.

In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in VorÃ³nezh,
ordered things he had long beenhis stay in VorÃ³nezh
and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind,
everything went well and easily.

The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a
horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy
and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who
owned some splendid horses.

In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six
thousand rublesâ€”to serve, as he who could at all vie with the
cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured
and well-bred Count RostÃ³v. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an
officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that
prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian
was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him
that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he treated him
cordially though with sidered such a very free and easy manner improper and in
bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by
something unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular
thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces.

All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and
pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.
With the naÃ¯ve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other menâ€™s
wivesshoulders) â€œlike Dianaâ€™s....â€

The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking
about.

â€œAh, NikÃ­ta IvÃ¡nych!â€ cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing
NikÃ­ta IvÃ¡nych to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention
to elope with a blonde lady.

The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governorâ€™s good-natured
wife came up with a look of disapproval.

â€œAnna IgnÃ¡tyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,â€ sai after repeating her invitation to
come to see her.

Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention
of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear,
which he himself did not understand.

When he had parted from MalvÃ­ntseva Nicholas wished to return to the
dancing, but the governorâ€™s little wife placed her plump hand on his
sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to
her sitting room, from wd SÃ³nya...?â€ And on taking leave of the governorâ€™s wife,
when she again smilingly said to him, â€œWell then, remember!â€ he drew her
aside.

â€œBut see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...â€

â€œWhat is it, my dear? Come, letâ€™s sit down here,â€ said she.

Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or
his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwardsd
will do so.... So you see there can be no question aboutâ€”â€ said Nicholas
incoherently and blushing.

â€œMy dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know SÃ³nya has nothing and
you yourself say your Papaâ€™s affairs are in a very bad way. And what
about your mother? It would kill her, thatâ€™s one thing. And what sort of
life would it be for SÃ³nyaâ€”if sheâ€™s a girl with a heart? Your mother
in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and SÃ³nya ought totoo about her nephewâ€™s education for which she had always felt
herself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peaceâ€”a
peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams
and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were
related to her meeting with RostÃ³v.

The day after her party the governorâ€™s wife came to see MalvÃ­ntseva
and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though
under present co him, and these words sometimes seemed
undeservedly cold and then to mean too much. More than anything she
feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as
soon as she saw him.

But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
room that Count RostÃ³v had called, the princess showed no confusion,
only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
and radiant light.

â€œYou have met him, Aunt?â€ said shskillful, artistic
work on its sides, that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless,
was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first
time all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had
lived appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction
with herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her
meekness, love, and self-sacrificeâ€”all this now shone in those radiant
eyes, in her delicate smile, andthere are children, turned to Prince Andrewâ€™s little son, caressing him
and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on
his knee, played with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a
softened, happy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms
of the man she loved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if
understanding it, flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with
good natured playfulness.

As she was in mourning Prin
externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him
and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he
had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met
in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously,
thought about SÃ³nya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as
almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife,
adapting her in his imagination to all the conditio with his servant and squadron quartermaster.

A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which
Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory.
He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military
decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects.
When the service was over the governorâ€™s wife beckoned him to her.

â€œHave you seen the princess?â€ she asked, indicating with a movement of
ases of a splinter woundâ€ (the Gazette said
it was a shell) â€œeither proving fatal at once or being very slight,â€
continued Nicholas. â€œWe must hope for the best, and I am sure...â€

Princess Mary interrupted him.

â€œOh, that would be so dread...â€ she began and, prevented by agitation
from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as
everything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully,
went out, following her aunt.

That ev that very sorrow which revealed
the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible
attraction.

â€œShe must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!â€ he said to himself.
â€œWhy am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with SÃ³nya?â€ And he
involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and
the abundance of it in the otherâ€”a spirituality he himself lacked and
therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen un out into the yard to see whether it had done so. No,
but I am not praying for trifles now,â€ he thought as he put his pipe
down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself before the icon.
Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not
done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the
door opened and LavrÃºshka came in with some papers.

â€œBlockhead! Why do you come in without being called?â€ cried Nicholas,
quiceatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry
Princess BolkÃ³nskaya, together with his silence and coldness of late,
had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and
set him completely free.

It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow
or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my
love has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I
beg you to consider yourself free, and tof
making humiliating or cruel allusions to SÃ³nya.

But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that
was going on, she called SÃ³nya to her and, instead of reproaching and
making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself
and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
engagement with Nicholas.

â€œI shall not be at peace till you promise me this.â€

SÃ³nya burst into hysterical tears and replied through heaving answered
the countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and
resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him
free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.

The bustle and terror of the RostÃ³vsâ€™ last days in Moscow stifled the
gloomy thoughts that oppressed SÃ³nya. She was glad to find escape
from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrewâ€™s
presence in their house, despite her e on his right arm, she went up to SÃ³nya and took her hand.

â€œNatÃ¡sha, what are you about? Come here!â€ said the countess.

NatÃ¡sha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray
for aid to God and His saint.

As soon as the prior withdrew, NatÃ¡sha took her friend by the hand and
went with her into the unoccupied room.

â€œSÃ³nya, will he live?â€ she asked. â€œSÃ³nya, how happy I am, and how
unhappy!... SÃ³nya, dovey, everything is as it u about Prince Andrew whom she had seen
lying down.

â€œYou remember?â€ SÃ³nya went on. â€œI saw it then and told everybody, you
and DunyÃ¡sha. I saw him lying on a bed,â€ said she, making a gesture with
her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, â€œand that he had his eyes
closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were
folded,â€ she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just
seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirrosk, fear of a refusal, and
readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.

SÃ³nya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.

â€œYes, Mamma, I will write,â€ said she.

SÃ³nya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that
day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her
vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of NatÃ¡shaâ€™s relations with
Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the
other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was
required by an officer.

All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and,
recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as
he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.

That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among
them) were to be tried for incendiary and trial seemed unnecessary. It was
evident that any answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he
was doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner
that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the
flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he â€œwas
protecting a woman,â€ and that â€œto protect a woman who was being insulted
was the duty of every man; that...â€ They interrupted him, for this
was notination, were the hardest of all for Pierre.





CHAPTER X

On the eighth of September an officerâ€”a very important one judging by
the respect the guards showed himâ€”entered the coach house where the
prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding
a paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming
Pierre as â€œthe man who does not give his name.â€ Glancing indolently and
indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered ruined and destroyed, but in
place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre
unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been
established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of
the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were
escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the looks of an
important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier,
whom they met on the way. He felt iucted through a glass gallery,
an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low
study at the door of which stood an adjutant.

Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of
the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting
a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes,
he said in a low voice:

â€œWho are you?â€

Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a wordbut in a pleading
voice.

Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked
at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war
and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At
that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their
minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and
were brothers.

At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the
ptupefied,
and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others
did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his
mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to
death? Not the men on the commission that had first examined himâ€”not one
of them wished to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout,
who had looked at him in so human a way. In another moment Davout would
have realized that he was doing wrongHe could only hear and see. And he had only one wishâ€”that
the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre
looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.

The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin,
the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was
a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a
plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome
man wim louder than the most terrific
thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen
were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands.
Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks,
these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for
protection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe
what was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because they
alone knew whg him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got
him to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something.
Whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought
it incredible that men should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at
the post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded
animal looked around him with glittering eyes.

Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity
and agite traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.

Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with
his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other.
That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls
of earth were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the
soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to
go back. But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the postced alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.

Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and
told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for
the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him, Pierre
got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of the
field, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams,
and battens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twer to regain faith in the meaning of life.

Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and
asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he
found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and
talking on all sides.

â€œWell, then, mates... that very prince who...â€ some voice at the other
end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphad of his bed, and, seating himself
comfortably, clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes
on Pierre. The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting,
and well-rounded in these deft movements, in the manâ€™s well-ordered
arrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at
the man without taking his eyes from him.

â€œYouâ€™ve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?â€ the little man suddenly said.

And there was so much kindlinâ€œYou should
do like this.â€

He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two
equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the
rag, and handed it to Pierre.

â€œThe potatoes are grand!â€ he said once more. â€œEat some like that!â€

Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.

â€œOh, Iâ€™m all right,â€ said he, â€œbut why did they shoot those poor
fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.â€

â€œT,â€ he added rapidly.

â€œWhat? What did you say?â€ asked Pierre.

â€œWho? I?â€ said KaratÃ¡ev. â€œI say things happen not as we plan but as God
judges,â€ he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said
before, and immediately continued:

â€œWell, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have
abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still
living?â€ he asked.

And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, turned out a blessing! If it had not been for
my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger
brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife
behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a
soldier. I come home on leave and Iâ€™ll tell you how it was, I look and
see that they are living better than before. The yard full of cattle,
the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the
youngest fallen asleep. â€œWhat was I saying?
I was praying. Donâ€™t you pray?â€

â€œYes, I do,â€ said Pierre. â€œBut what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?â€

â€œWell, of course,â€ replied PlatÃ³n quickly, â€œthe horsesâ€™ saints. One must
pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now youâ€™ve curled up and got warm,
you daughter of a bitch!â€ said KaratÃ¡ev, touching the dog that lay at
his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.

Sounds of crying anid not himself
know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly
white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he
laughedâ€”as he often didâ€”were all sound and good, there was not a gray
hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression
of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance.

His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of
innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and, he seemed to
have thrown off all that had been forced upon himâ€”everything military
and alien to himselfâ€”and had returned to his former peasant habits.

â€œA soldier on leaveâ€”a shirt outside breeches,â€ he would say.

He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not
complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during
the whole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally
some old and evidently precious, the French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt
that in spite of KaratÃ¡evâ€™s affectionate tenderness for him (by which
he unconsciously gave Pierreâ€™s spiritual life its due) he would not have
grieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in
the same way toward KaratÃ¡ev.

To all the other prisoners PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev seemed a most ordinary
soldier. They called him â€œlittle falconâ€ or â€œPlatÃ³sha,â€ chaffed him
good-naturedlerself but to take
her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, possible or
impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it was her duty,
not only to herself, to be near her brother who was perhaps dying, but
to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared
to set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess
Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the
long journey too hard and tooefinitely to herself
in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview with
Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the
RostÃ³vs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that
Prince Andrewâ€™s relations with NatÃ¡sha might, if he recovered, be
renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of
this.

Yet in spite of that, his relation to herâ€”considerate, delicate, and
lovingâ€”not only remainedalled
by the terrible pallor of the princessâ€™ face that looked out at him from
the window.

â€œI have found out everything, your excellency: the RostÃ³vs are staying
at the merchant BrÃ³nnikovâ€™s house, in the Square not far from here,
right above the VÃ³lga,â€ said the courier.

Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding
why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her
brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that quesalized that this was the
countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly
knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in
French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and
asked: â€œHow is he?â€

â€œThe doctor says that he is not in danger,â€ said the countess, but as
she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a
contradiction of her words.

â€œWhere is he? Can I see himâ€”can I?â€is my niece,â€ said the count, introducing SÃ³nyaâ€”â€œYou donâ€™t know
her, Princess?â€

Princess Mary turned to SÃ³nya and, trying to stifle the hostile
feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt
oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far
from what was in her own heart.

â€œWhere is he?â€ she asked again, addressing them all.

â€œHe is downstairs. NatÃ¡sha is with him,â€ answered SÃ³nya, flushing. â€œWe

pleasure.

â€œCome, come to him, Mary,â€ said NatÃ¡sha, leading her into the other
room.

Princess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to NatÃ¡sha.
She felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn
everything.

â€œHow...â€ she began her question but stopped short.

She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.
NatÃ¡shaâ€™s face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and
profoundly.

NatÃ¡sha was gazing know why, but you will see what he is like.â€

â€œIs he weaker? Thinner?â€ asked the princess.

â€œNo, itâ€™s not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too good, he
cannot, cannot live, because...â€





CHAPTER XV

When NatÃ¡sha opened Prince Andrewâ€™s door with a familiar movement and
let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the
sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now
tried to remain tranqu guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and
eyes.

â€œBut in what am I to blame?â€ she asked herself. And his cold, stern look
replied: â€œBecause you are alive and thinking of the living, while I...â€

In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there
was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and
NatÃ¡sha.

He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.

â€œHow are you, Mary? How brought us together,â€ said he,
breaking the silence and pointing to NatÃ¡sha. â€œShe looks after me all
the time.â€

Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a
thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,
before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he
could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had
not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her .

â€œWhy talk of me?â€ she said quietly and glanced at NatÃ¡sha.

NatÃ¡sha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again
silent.

â€œAndrew, would you like...â€ Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling
voice, â€œwould you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking
about you!â€

Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but
Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did
not smile with pleasunderstand that all those feelings they prize soâ€”all our feelings,
all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot
understand one another,â€ and he remained silent.


Prince Andrewâ€™s little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew
nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge,
observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he
afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more p strange
lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable....


Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly
tormenting fear of deathâ€”the endâ€”but now he no longer understood that
fear.

He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before
him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and
knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to himself after
being wounded and the flowerrÃ¡gin was alive. And he dared not inquire.

His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what NatÃ¡sha
referred to when she said: â€œThis suddenly happened,â€ had occurred two
days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle
between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It was
the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as
presented to him in the form of his love for NatÃ¡sha, and a last, though
ultimatelt if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had
brought them together again, but after that they never spoke of the
future.

â€œCan it or can it not be?â€ he now thought as he looked at her and
listened to the light click of the steel needles. â€œCan fate have brought
me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the
truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent
my life in falsity? I love her more than any, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her
stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.

Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and
suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.

As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now
always occupied his mindâ€”about life and death, and chiefly about death.
He felt himself nearer to it.

â€œLove? What is love?â€ he thoughthat fear was the fear of death. It
stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward
the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing
against it and forcing its way in. Something not humanâ€”deathâ€”was
breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the
door, making a final effort to hold it backâ€”to lock it was no longer
possibleâ€”but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from
behind by therrible or violent in this comparatively slow
awakening.

His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both
Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did
not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt
that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left
them) but on what reminded them most closely of himâ€”his body. Both felt
this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death  of him and they all wept.

Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity.
The countess and SÃ³nya cried from pity for NatÃ¡sha and because he was
no more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too,
must take the same terrible step.

NatÃ¡sha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their own
personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which
had taken possession of their souls at the consciouthat the
earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who
admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there
were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets. There
is, and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of
all causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws
are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.
The discovery of these laws is only pos impossible to understand by
what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver
was a profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why
they think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy
the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied,
or followed by other circumstances, might have proved ruinous to the
Russians and salutary for the French. If the position of the Russian
army really began to 
At the council at FilÃ­ the prevailing thought in the minds of the
Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a
direct retreat by the NÃ­zhni road. In proof of this there is the fact
that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and above
all there is the well-known conversation after the council, between the
commander in chief and LanskÃ³y, who was in charge of the commissariat
department. LanskÃ³y informed the commander in chiefay
precisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to TarÃºtino. Only
when the army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying
forces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this
movement and long ago foreseen its result.





CHAPTER II

The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance
of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually
retreating straight back from the invaders, deviathe battle of
BorodinÃ³ had been a victory, he aloneâ€”who as commander in chief might
have been expected to be eager to attackâ€”employed his whole strength to
restrain the Russian army from useless engagements.

The beast wounded at BorodinÃ³ was lying where the fleeing hunter had
left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and
merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was heard
to moan.

The moan of that wounded beast (the tacking
at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauristonâ€™s
mission; the abundance of provisions at TarÃºtino; the reports coming in
from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of
recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian
soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been
assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been
resting; curiosity as to what the French ght be encountered, as well as fresh people who
were to watch KutÃºzovâ€™s actions and report upon them.

Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized.
The posts left vacant by BagratiÃ³n, who had been killed, and by
Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious
consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to
put A in Bâ€™s place and B in Dâ€™s, or on the contrary to put D in Aâ€™s
place, and so one to the army, is in danger.
From General Wintzingerodeâ€™s reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten
thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several
thousand men is moving on DmÃ­trov. A third has advanced along the
VladÃ­mir road, and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed
between RÃºza and MozhÃ¡ysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as
the twenty-fifth. In view of all this information, when the enemy has
scattered his forlf felt in Petersburg, was dispatched,
KutÃºzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he
commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.

On the second of October a Cossack, ShapovÃ¡lov, who was out scouting,
killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded hare he made
his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Muratâ€™s
army, encamped there without any precautions. The Cossack laughingly
told his comrades how he h”gave
his approval, that is, to the accomplished fact.





CHAPTER IV

Bennigsenâ€™s note and the Cossackâ€™s information that the left flank
of the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it was
necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of October.

On the morning of the fourth of October KutÃºzov signed the dispositions.
Toll read them to ErmÃ³lov, asking him to attend to the further
arrangements.

â€œAll rightâ€”all righr searched till six oâ€™clock in the
evening without even stopping to eat. ErmÃ³lov was nowhere to be found
and no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at
a comradeâ€™s, and rode again to the vanguard to find MilorÃ¡dovich.
MilorÃ¡dovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a
ball at General KÃ­kinâ€™s and that ErmÃ³lov was probably there too.

â€œBut where is it?â€

â€œWhy, there, over at Ã‰chkino,â€ said a Cossack officer, pch! Ha, ha, ha!â€

The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment
he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait; but one of
the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come about, informed
ErmÃ³lov.

ErmÃ³lov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the
officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.


â€œYou think he went off just by chance?â€ said a comrade, who was on the
staff that evenNot rec...â€ KutÃºzov began, but checked himself immediately and
sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his calÃ¨che, he waited with
drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down. When
EÃ½khen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared,
KutÃºzov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame
for the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance
for him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and pantinovnÃ­tsyn,
and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next
day. And once more KutÃºzov had to consent.





CHAPTER VI

Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening
and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with dark purple
clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops
advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery
could be faintly heard. The men were forbmuch disputing and arguing,
Major-General GrÃ©kov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the
Polish sergeant.

â€œNow, remember,â€ said Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov to the sergeant at parting,
â€œif you have been lying Iâ€™ll have you hanged like a dog; but if itâ€™s
true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!â€

Without replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and rode
away with GrÃ©kov whose men had quickly assembled. They disappeared into
the forest,back, fetch them back!â€ said Count OrlÃ³v with sudden
determination, looking at his watch. â€œIt will be too late. It is quite
light.â€

And the adjutant galloped through the forest after GrÃ©kov. When GrÃ©kov
returned, Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov, excited both by the abandoned attempt and
by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear, as
well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance. All his men
felt the same excitement.

â€œMount!â€ dvanced no further.

Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that â€œthe First
Column will marchâ€ and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,
commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order
and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed
places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt;
murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and finally a
backward movement. Adjutants and gen his men under fire, without considering in his
agitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would
be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he
needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other
bullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for
some time quite uselessly.





CHAPTER VII

Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front,
but KutÃºzrmÃ³lov moved up to KutÃºzov and respectfully remarked:

â€œIt is not too late yet, your Highnessâ€”the enemy has not gone awayâ€”if
you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see
a little smoke.â€

KutÃºzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Muratâ€™s troops
were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he
halted for three quarters of an hour.

The whole battle consisted in what OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sovâ€™s Cose descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we
find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously
formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions
are false.

The battle of TarÃºtino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in
viewâ€”to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
dispositions; nor that which Count OrlÃ³v-DenÃ­sov may have had in viewâ€”to
take Murat prisoner; nor the result of mpt to attack for
a whole month. Napoleonâ€™s position is most brilliant. He can either fall
on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate
an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on
Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to SmolÃ©nsk or
VÃ­lna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be
required to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time.
For that, only very simy,
the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series
of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose,
independently of anything the Russian army might do.

Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his
army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as
unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he
wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.

In both cas he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence
of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not
disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his
army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people
of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic
considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.





CHAPTER IX

With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately 
punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to
put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A
paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your
municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your
needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red
ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear
a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a ion one to
another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the
military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!


With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the
troops in turn should enter Moscow Ã  la maraude * to obtain provisions
for themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.

    * As looters.

With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back
and services
the soil. The government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom
of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants, husbandmen, and those
living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their
supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets, of which one is on
the MokhovÃ¡ya Street and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such
supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may
agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fain with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He
visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him
to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with TutÃ³lmin. Then, as
Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged
Russian money which he had prepared: â€œRaising the use of these means
by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief
be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food was too
precwhen he
left Moscowâ€”as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to
be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so
concerned, produced an unheard-of result. The French generals lost touch
with the Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it
was only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skillâ€”and apparently
the geniusâ€”of Murat.

With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleonâ€™s arguments as to his
magnanimilled them.

As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,
these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the
KrÃ©mlin and in PosnyÃ¡kovâ€™s house were closed again at once because the
actors and actresses were robbed.

Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as
well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The
French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the
paper monhat the picked soldiers appointed to guard his
person, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to
such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army
supplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying
sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.â€

â€œThe Grand Marshal of the palace,â€ wrote the governor, â€œcomplains
bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to
commit nul tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it
entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps
and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal,
hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunterâ€™s gun, runs forward and
back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his
whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of TarÃºtino
frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunll on its back, yelping with
delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and
now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.

Pierreâ€™s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only
remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldierâ€™s trousers which by
KaratÃ¡evâ€™s advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and
a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this
time. He no longer seemed stout, t distance,
with the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare trees,
the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire,
and the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out in the
transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness.
Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion
occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green
beside the fence. And even that ruined andg chats with Pierre
and showed him all sorts of favors.)

â€œâ€˜You see, St. Thomas,â€™ he said to me the other day. â€˜Monsieur Kiril is
a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has
had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows whatâ€™s what.... If he wants
anything and asks me, he wonâ€™t get a refusal. When one has studied, you
see, one likes education and well-bred people.â€™ It is for your sake I
mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day inchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his
hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had
a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare
body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on
would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None
of the prisoners said a word.

â€œSee, it fits well!â€ PlatÃ³n kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.

The Frenchman, havidear!â€ muttered KaratÃ¡ev and went
away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then
looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierreâ€™s look had told him
something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:

â€œPlatoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!â€ And handing back the odd
bits he turned and went out.

â€œThere, look at that,â€ said KaratÃ¡ev, swaying his head. â€œPeople said
they were not Christians, but they too have souls. Iiled him. And now without thinking
about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the
horror of death, through privation, and through what he recognized in
KaratÃ¡ev.

Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it
were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating
thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did
not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or
Napole€™s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to
be indubitably manâ€™s highest happiness. Here and now for the first time
he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat,
drinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of
warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to
talk and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of oneâ€™s needsâ€”good
food, cleanliness, and freedomâ€”now that he was deprived of all this,
seemes and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the
river, all began to sparkle in the glad lightâ€”Pierre felt a new joy and
strength in life such as he had never before known. And this not only
stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in
strength as the hardships of his position increased.

That feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still
further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners
formed of him sooe and thin with dark
shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed.
His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly
at his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned
regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that
caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being
left alone.

Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes KaratÃ¡ev had
made for him said Pierre to himself, and an
involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporalâ€™s changed face,
in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the
drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled
people against their will to kill their fellow menâ€”that force the effect
of which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to try to
escape that force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those who
served as its bout thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and
about three hundred men.

The officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to
Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his
shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major
with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a KazÃ¡n dressing
gown tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of
his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, id ZÃºbova, and in the KrÃ©mlin.... Just look! Thereâ€™s not half of
it left. Yes, I told youâ€”the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it
is.â€

â€œWell, you know itâ€™s burned, so whatâ€™s the use of talking?â€ said the
major.

As they passed near a church in the KhamÃ³vniki (one of the few unburned
quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one
side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.

â€œAh, the villains! What heathenrt.

Davoutâ€™s troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the
Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the KalÃºga road.
But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnaisâ€™
train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the KalÃºga road when
the vanguard of Neyâ€™s army was already emerging from the Great OrdÃ½nka
Street.

When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps
forward, halted, and agng. Look, look there.... Why, that must be
Napoleonâ€™s own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! Itâ€™s
like a portable house.... That fellowâ€™s dropped his sack and doesnâ€™t see
it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either!
Yes, I dare say, thatâ€™s the way theyâ€™ll let you pass.... Just look,
thereâ€™s no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven, so they are! In
carriagesâ€”see how comfortably theyâ€™ve settled themselves!â€

Ad all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute
and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the
corporalâ€™s face when the drums were beating.

It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort
collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among
the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged
onto the KalÃºga road.

They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only whenover the roll of
prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian
soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw
a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from
the road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to
court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the
Russian. To the noncommissioned officerâ€™s excuse that the prisoner was
ill and could not walk, thelk to them. On
the road he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.

Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an
unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and
dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the
cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he
burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that
men from various sides turned with suugh
Napoleon was already not far from KutÃºzov on the old KalÃºga road.
KutÃºzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly
brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.

Soon after that a report was received from DÃ³rokhovâ€™s guerrilla
detachment operating to the left of TarÃºtino that troops of Broussierâ€™s
division had been seen at FormÃ­nsk and that being separated from the
rest of the French army they might easily be dest of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the
French artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was
this same irresolute and undiscerning DokhtÃºrovâ€”KutÃºzov hastening to
rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first.
And the quiet little DokhtÃºrov rode thither, and BorodinÃ³ became the
greatest glory of the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to
us in verse and prose, but of DokhtÃºrov scarcely a worides
DÃ³rokhovâ€™s detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and
SeslÃ¡vin.

On the evening of October 11 SeslÃ¡vin came to the AristÃ³vo headquarters
with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the
troops that had entered FormÃ­nsk that day were the vanguard of the whole
army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four
days previously. That same evening a house serf who had come from
BÃ³rovsk said he had seen nd throwing down his reins, he entered
a dark passage.

â€œThe general on duty, quick! Itâ€™s very important!â€ said he to someone
who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.

â€œHe has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night
he has not slept,â€ said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. â€œYou should
wake the captain first.â€

â€œBut this is very important, from General DokhtÃºrov,â€ said
BolkhovÃ­tinov, entering the open door whi candle, from
the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
running away, and looked at the messenger. BolkhovÃ­tinov was bespattered
all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.

â€œWho gave the report?â€ inquired ShcherbÃ­nin, taking the envelope.

â€œThe news is reliable,â€ said BolkhovÃ­tinov. â€œPrisoners, Cossacks, and
the scouts all say the same thing.â€

â€œThereâ€™s nothing to be done, weâ€™ll have to conviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this
and still less speak about it, but must only attend to oneâ€™s own work.
And he did his work, giving his whole strength to the task.

Peter PetrÃ³vich KonovnÃ­tsyn, like DokhtÃºrov, seems to have been included
merely for proprietyâ€™s sake in the list of the so-called heroes of
1812â€”the Barclays, RaÃ©vskis, ErmÃ³lovs, PlÃ¡tovs, and MilorÃ¡doviches. Like
DokhtÃºrov he had the reputation of being a pectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed
without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.

So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on
his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the
darkness.

Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more
influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, KutÃºzov
was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops ems to
them that when they have thought of two or three contingenciesâ€ (he
remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) â€œthey have
foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.â€

The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at BorodinÃ³ was
mortal or not had hung over KutÃºzovâ€™s head for a whole month. On the one
hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other KutÃºzov felt assured
with all his being that the terrible blow intoition that
the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were
only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not to
KutÃºzov. With his sixty yearsâ€™ experience he knew what value to attach
to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news
so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew how readily
in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary. And the more
he desired it the less he allowedn on his chest,
â€œcome nearerâ€”nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon
has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?â€

BolkhovÃ­tinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had
been told to report.

â€œSpeak quicker, quicker! Donâ€™t torture me!â€ KutÃºzov interrupted him.

BolkhovÃ­tinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting
instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but KutÃºzov checked
him. He tried to say something, bt armyâ€”which had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had
trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them, and on arriving at
SmolÃ©nsk had looted provisions instead of storing themâ€”how could that
army recuperate in KalÃºga province, which was inhabited by Russians such
as those who lived in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of
consuming what was set ablaze?

That army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of BorodinÃ³
and the pillage of Moscow he
Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very
thing that was destroying the French army, the booty on which the
Cossacks fell. Here as at TarÃºtino they went after plunder, leaving the
men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon
managed to escape.

When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself
in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but
to fly as fast as possible crowd.

For the French retreating along the old SmolÃ©nsk road, the final
goalâ€”their native landâ€”was too remote, and their immediate goal
was SmolÃ©nsk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously
intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that
much food and fresh troops awaited them in SmolÃ©nsk, nor that they were
told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself,
knew that provisions were scarce there), but bd a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the
body could hasten the process of decomposition.

A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a certain
limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow. On
the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow
becomes.

Of the Russian commanders KutÃºzov alone understood this. When the flight
of the French army along the SmolÃ©nsk road became well defined, what
Kondanger, continued, while steadily melting
away, to pursue its fatal path to SmolÃ©nsk.





BOOK FOURTEEN: 1812





CHAPTER I

The Battle of BorodinÃ³, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it
and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the
most instructive phenomena in history.

All historians agree that the external activity of states and nations
in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a
direct roy the independent
existence of Prussia.

But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is
taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that
ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and
then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of
history: to say that the field of battle at BorodinÃ³ remained in the
hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles
that destroyed h have it.

The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants
Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their
carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest
any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such
peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered
them, but burned it instead.

Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers
accor
attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponentâ€™s rapier saw a cudgel
raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to KutÃºzov and to
the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all
the rulesâ€”as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the
complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in
spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather
disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wasus, and
by the Russians in 1812.

People have called this kind of war â€œguerrilla warfareâ€ and assume that
by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does
not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule
of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an
attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his
opponent at the moment of conflict.

Guerrilla war (always successful, as histoknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the
greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men
composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are not,
fighting under the command of a genius, in twoâ€”or three-line formation,
with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men
who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous
conditions for fighting.

The spirit of an army is the act in masses when attacking, and
in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the
strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under
fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed
than is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of
account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in
particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or
fall in the spirit ments became.

The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the
fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered treeâ€”the
French armyâ€”and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when
the French were fleeing toward SmolÃ©nsk, there were hundreds of such
companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted
all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the
comforts of life. Others consisted soleand his party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching
from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of
cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the
army, whichâ€”as was learned from spies and prisonersâ€”was moving under a
strong escort to SmolÃ©nsk. Besides DenÃ­sov and DÃ³lokhov (who also led
a small party and moved in DenÃ­sovâ€™s vicinity), the commanders of some
large divisions with staffs also knew of this ry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not
far from MikÃºlino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then,
and until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French
without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach ShÃ¡mshevo
quietly without alarming them and then, after joining DÃ³lokhov who was
to come that evening to a consultation at a watchmanâ€™s hut in the forest
less than a mile from ShÃ¡mshevo, to surprise the French at dawn, falling then
suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.

DenÃ­sov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down
was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse,
which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving
rain and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick
black beard looked angry.

Beside DenÃ­sov rode an esaul, * DenÃ­sovâ€™s fellow worker, also in felt
cloak and sheepskin cap, and rh horsecloths over their heads. The horses,
being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay.
Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely
thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet,
slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed
the road. The men sat huddled up trying not to stir, so as to warm the
water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold
water that t is not presupposable
that it is the lieutenant colonel himself,â€ said the esaul, who was fond
of using words the Cossacks did not know.

The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer
visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary
gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and
drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,
standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer,

â€œMichael FeoklÃ­tych,â€ said he to the esaul, â€œthis is again fwom that
German, you know. Heâ€â€”he indicated PÃ©tyaâ€”â€œis serving under him.â€

And DenÃ­sov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a
repetition of the German generalâ€™s demand that he should join forces
with him for an attack on the transport.

â€œIf we donâ€™t take it tomowwow, heâ€™ll snatch it fwom under our noses,â€ he
added.

While DenÃ­sov was talking to the esaul, PÃ© and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the
hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the
edge of the forest.





CHAPTER V

The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from
the trees. DenÃ­sov, the esaul, and PÃ©tya rode silently, following the
peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes
and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves,
silently led them to the edgng DenÃ­sov asked him. DenÃ­sov turned away from him
frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.

PÃ©tya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now
at DenÃ­sov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and
along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.

â€œWhether DÃ³lokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?â€ said DenÃ­sov with
a merry sparkle in his eyes.

â€œIt is a very suitable spot,â€ suing him stopped.

â€œSmart, that!â€ said the esaul.

â€œWhat a beast!â€ said DenÃ­sov with his former look of vexation. â€œWhat has
he been doing all this time?â€

â€œWho is he?â€ asked PÃ©tya.

â€œHeâ€™s our plastÃºn. I sent him to capture a â€˜tongue.â€™â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ said PÃ©tya, nodding at the first words DenÃ­sov uttered as if
he understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of
it.

TÃ­khon ShcherbÃ¡ty was one of the most indishing water,
flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude
for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always
brought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring
in French captives also. DenÃ­sov then relieved him from drudgery and
began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him
enrolled among the Cossacks.

TÃ­khon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging
behind thehe bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more
opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen,
and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars
and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by DenÃ­sov
overnight to ShÃ¡mshevo to capture a â€œtongue.â€ But whether because he
had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept
through the night, he had crept by day into some bushe dawn,â€ TÃ­khon continued, spreading
out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. â€œI took him
into the forest. Then I see heâ€™s no good and think Iâ€™ll go and fetch a
likelier one.â€

â€œYou see?... What a wogueâ€”itâ€™s just as I thought,â€ said DenÃ­sov to the
esaul. â€œWhy didnâ€™t you bwing that one?â€

â€œWhat was the good of bringing him?â€ TÃ­khon interrupted hastily and
angrilyâ€”â€œthat one wouldnâ€™t have done for you. As if I donâ€™of merry laughter in which TÃ­khon himself joined.

â€œOh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,â€ said TÃ­khon. â€œThe clothes
on himâ€”poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why,
he says: â€˜Iâ€™m a generalâ€™s son myself, I wonâ€™t go!â€™ he says.â€

â€œYou are a bwute!â€ said DenÃ­sov. â€œI wanted to question...â€

â€œBut I questioned him,â€ said TÃ­khon. â€œHe said he didnâ€™t know much.
â€˜There are a lot of us,â€™ he says, â€˜but allsov at once cheered up and, calling PÃ©tya to him, said: â€œWell, tell
me about yourself.â€





CHAPTER VII

PÃ©tya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined
his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a
large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission,
and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in
the battle of VyÃ¡zma, PÃ©tya had been in a constant state of blissful
exct DenÃ­sov was a hero, the esaul a hero,
and TÃ­khon a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave
them at a moment of difficulty.

It was already growing dusk when DenÃ­sov, PÃ©tya, and the esaul rode up
to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, and
Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and
were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French
could not see the smoke. In the passage of e handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.

â€œPlease keep it. I have several like it,â€ said PÃ©tya, blushing.
â€œHeavens! I was quite forgetting!â€ he suddenly cried. â€œI have some
raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and
he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something
sweet. Would you like some?...â€ and PÃ©tya ran out into the passage to
his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about g to
eat?... Perhaps...â€

â€œYes, heâ€™s a poor little fellow,â€ said DenÃ­sov, who evidently saw
nothing shameful in this reminder. â€œCall him in. His name is Vincent
Bosse. Have him fetched.â€

â€œIâ€™ll call him,â€ said PÃ©tya.

â€œYes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,â€ DenÃ­sov repeated.

PÃ©tya was standing at the door when DenÃ­sov said this. He slipped in
between the officers, came close to DenÃ­sov, and said:

â€œLet me kiss you, dear old felice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.

    * â€œThank you, sir.â€


There were many things PÃ©tya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did
not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in
the darkness he took the boyâ€™s hand and pressed it.

â€œCome in, come in!â€ he repeated in a gentle whisper. â€œOh, what can I do
for him?â€ he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.

When the boy had entered t up to DenÃ­sov and began
questioning him about the matter in hand. DenÃ­sov told him of the
designs the large detachments had on the transport, of the message PÃ©tya
had brought, and his own replies to both generals. Then he told him all
he knew of the French detachment.

â€œThatâ€™s so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,â€
said DÃ³lokhov. â€œIt will be necessary to go there. We canâ€™t start the
affair without knowing for certain how many ther™ve not said anything! I only say that Iâ€™ll certainly go with
you,â€ said PÃ©tya shyly.

â€œBut for you and me, old fellow, itâ€™s time to drop these amenities,â€
continued DÃ³lokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of
this subject which irritated DenÃ­sov. â€œNow, why have you kept this lad?â€
he went on, swaying his head. â€œBecause you are sorry for him! Donâ€™t we
know those â€˜receiptsâ€™ of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty
get tver considered personal danger.

â€œFor youâ€™ll admit that if we donâ€™t know for sure how many of them there
are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two
of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so donâ€™t
hinder me,â€ said he. â€œIt will only make things worse....â€





CHAPTER IX

Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, PÃ©tya and DÃ³lokhov rode to
the clearing from which DenÃ­sov had reconnoitered the Frencround, sentinels donâ€™t ask
     him for the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is
     here.â€


And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped
aside, DÃ³lokhov rode up the incline at a walk.

Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, DÃ³lokhov stopped
him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man,
a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to
DÃ³lokhovâ€™s horse, touched it with reeted DÃ³lokhov as a
stranger, asking what he could do for him.

DÃ³lokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their
regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew
anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and PÃ©tya
thought the officers were beginning to look at him and DÃ³lokhov with
hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.

â€œIf you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too nge
that PÃ©tya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise,
and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.

No one replied a word to DÃ³lokhovâ€™s laughter, and a French officer whom
they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered
something to a companion. DÃ³lokhov got up and called to the soldier who
was holding their horses.

â€œWill they bring our horses or not?â€ thought PÃ©tya, instinctively
drawing nearer to DÃ³loe darkness.





CHAPTER X

Having returned to the watchmanâ€™s hut, PÃ©tya found DenÃ­sov in the
passage. He was awaiting PÃ©tyaâ€™s return in a state of agitation,
anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.

â€œThank God!â€ he exclaimed. â€œYes, thank God!â€ he repeated, listening to
PÃ©tyaâ€™s rapturous account. â€œBut, devil take you, I havenâ€™t slept because
of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before
morning.â€

â€œBu
â€œNo, ah... LikhachÃ«vâ€”isnâ€™t that your name? Do you know I have only just
come back! Weâ€™ve been into the French camp.â€

And PÃ©tya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but
also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life
than to act â€œjust anyhow.â€

â€œWell, you should get some sleep now,â€ said the Cossack.

â€œNo, I am used to this,â€ said PÃ©tya. â€œI say, arenâ€™t the flints in your
pistols worn out? I brougre, by the wheel!â€

The hussar took the cup.

â€œIt must be daylight soon,â€ said he, yawning, and went away.

PÃ©tya ought to have known that he was in a forest with DenÃ­sovâ€™s
guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon
captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under
it LikhachÃ«v was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark
blotch to the right was the watchmanâ€™s hut, and the red blotch below to
thack sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as
if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising
high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could
touch it with oneâ€™s hand.

PÃ©tyaâ€™s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.

The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and
jostled one another. Someone snored.

â€œOzheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...â€ hissed the saber against the whetstone,
and suddenly PÃ©tyay die away!â€ and the sounds obeyed him. â€œNow fuller,
more joyful. Still more and more joyful!â€ And from an unknown depth rose
increasingly triumphant sounds. â€œNow voices join in!â€ ordered PÃ©tya. And
at first from afar he heard menâ€™s voices and then womenâ€™s. The voices
grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and PÃ©tya listened to their
surpassing beauty in awe and joy.

With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the
trees, and theers to his men. PÃ©tya held his horse by the bridle,
impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face, having been bathed
in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant.
Cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.

â€œWell, is evâ€™wything weady?â€ asked DenÃ­sov. â€œBwing the horses.â€

The horses were brought. DenÃ­sov was angry with the Cossack because the
saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted

At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, PÃ©tya lashed his
horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding DenÃ­sov who
shouted at him. It seemed to PÃ©tya that at the moment the shot was
fired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.
Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge
he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on.
In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were! Wait
for the infantry!â€ he exclaimed as PÃ©tya rode up to him.

â€œWait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!â€ shouted PÃ©tya, and without pausing a moment
galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
smoke was thickest.

A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed
against something. The Cossacks and DÃ³lokhov galloped after PÃ©tya into
the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the
French threw down theiloodstained, mud-bespattered
face which had already gone white.

â€œI am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!â€ he
recalled PÃ©tyaâ€™s words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the
sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which DenÃ­sov turned away, walked to
the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.

Among the Russian prisoners rescued by DenÃ­sov and DÃ³lokhov was Pierre
BezÃºkhov.





CHAPTER XII

During the whole of their ma for their causeless panic.

These three groups traveling togetherâ€”the cavalry stores, the convoy of
prisoners, and Junotâ€™s baggage trainâ€”still constituted a separate and
united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.

Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and
twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been
captured or left behind. Some of Junotâ€™s wagons also had been captured
or abandoned. Three
The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners
should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned.
All who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had
rejoined KaratÃ¡ev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen
KaratÃ¡ev for its master.

On the third day after leaving Moscow KaratÃ¡ev again fell ill with the
fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew
gradually weaker Pierr having long since fallen to
pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wifeâ€”of his own free
will as it had seemed to himâ€”he had been no more free than now when they
locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself subsequently
termed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt, the worst
was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh
was appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder
they used  midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill along
the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the roughness of
the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and
then again at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar
and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side
of the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction
lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and tmidnight, the hour when KaratÃ¡ev was usually free of
his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the fire and
heard PlatÃ³nâ€™s voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face
brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His
feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away,
but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at
PlatÃ³n.

â€œWell, how are you?â€ he asked.

â€œHow am I? If was suffering for, and how they
had sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had
taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply
been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: â€˜What
are you being punished for, Daddy?â€™â€”â€˜I, my dear brothers,â€™ said he, â€˜am
being punished for my own and other menâ€™s sins. But I have not killed
anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my
poorer bhave taken six lives,â€™ he says (he was a great sinner),
â€˜but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Donâ€™t let him suffer
because of me.â€™ So he confessed and it was all written down and the
papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while
they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the
papers all in due formâ€”the authorities I meanâ€”time passed. The affair
reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsarâ€™s decree came: to seted
by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a
tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the
marshals. His eye fell on Pierreâ€™s large and striking figure, and in
the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he
detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.

The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a
red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Severalhom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and
in the expression on their facesâ€”one of them glanced timidly at
Pierreâ€”there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of
the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and
remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while
drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.

Behind him, where KaratÃ¡ev had been sitting, the dog began to howl.
â€œW Its whole surface consisted of drops
closely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed places,
sometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one dividing
into many. Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as
possible, but others striving to do the same compressed it, sometimes
destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.

â€œThat is life,â€ said the old teacher.

â€œHow simple and clear it is,â€ thought Pierre. â€œHow is it I di under the tree, of the shot
heard from that spot, of the dogâ€™s howl, of the guilty faces of the two
Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of
KaratÃ¡evâ€™s absence at this haltâ€”and he was on the point of realizing
that KaratÃ¡ev had been killed, but just at that instant, he knew not
why, the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent
with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And
without linki.

â€œHow many?â€ DÃ³lokhov asked the Cossack.

â€œThe second hundred,â€ replied the Cossack.

â€œFilez, filez!â€ * DÃ³lokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression
from the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they
flashed with a cruel light.

    * â€œGet along, get along!â€


DenÃ­sov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks
who were carrying the body of PÃ©tya RostÃ³v to a hole that had been dug
in the garden.
I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the various
corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last
two or three daysâ€™ march. They are almost disbanded. Scarcely a quarter
of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others
go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and
escape discipline. In general they regard SmolÃ©nsk as the place where
they hope to recover. During the last fthing in them was acted upon
for they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one
another Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, they all felt that they were
miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to
pay. And though they pretended to be concerned about the army, each
was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save
himself.





CHAPTER XVII

The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign
during their stay of four days they might have learned where
the enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan and
undertaken something new. But after a four daysâ€™ halt the mob, with no
maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither
to the right nor to the left but along the oldâ€”the worstâ€”road, through
KrÃ¡snoe and OrshÃ¡.

Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated
in their flight and spread out  a wooded spot.

From OrshÃ¡ they fled farther along the road to VÃ­lna, still playing
at blindmanâ€™s buff with the pursuing army. At the BerÃ«zina they again
became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those
who got across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a
fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone,
abandoning his companions. The others who could do so drove away too,
leaving those who could not to surrevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the
scattered fragments of the army he left behind.

     * â€œI have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act
     the general.â€


Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, especially
of Neyâ€”a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he made his way by
night around through the forest and across the Dnieper and escaped to
OrshÃ¡, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tea quâ€™un pas,â€ * said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been
repeating: â€œSublime! Grand! NapolÃ©on le Grand!â€ Du sublime au ridicule
il nâ€™y a quâ€™un pas.

    * â€œFrom the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.â€


And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with
the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit oneâ€™s own nothingness
and immeasurable meanness.

For us with the standard of good and evil given us by t KutÃºzov, ChichagÃ³v, and others
were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehensible
why, the position of the Russian army being what it was at KrÃ¡snoe and
at the BerÃ«zina (in both cases we had superior forces), the French army
with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not captured, if that was what
the Russians aimed at.

The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military
historians (to the effect that KutÃºzov hindered an attack) is he sovereigns and the generals,
from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this
last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of
cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.

There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been
senseless and its attainment quite impossible.

It would have been senseless, first because Napoleonâ€™s disorganized
army was flying from Russia with all pw that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should
run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said
in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even
that could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not
they who had suffered from the trampled beds.

But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have
been senseless, it was impossible.

It was impossible first becauseâ€”as experienthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world
began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained
in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its
strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying
itself.

During the movement of the Russian army from TarÃºtino to KrÃ¡snoe it
lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the
population of a large provincial town. Ha beautiful words
and sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.

To them the words of MilorÃ¡dovich seem very interesting, and so do their
surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question
of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves
does not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of
their investigation.

Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and
itating touch.

After Prince Andrewâ€™s death NatÃ¡sha and Princess Mary alike felt this.
Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of
death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face. They
carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact.
Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to
dinner, the maidâ€™s inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any
word of insincere or feeble symplled back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt
for the first fortnight. She received letters from her relations to
which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put
was damp and he began to cough; AlpÃ¡tych came to YaroslÃ¡vl with reports
on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they
should return to Moscow to the house on the VozdvÃ­zhenka Street, which
had remained uninjured and needed only slight repad to fall on. This solitude exhausted
and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as anyone
entered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and
picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the
intruder to go.

She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that
on whichâ€”with a terrible questioning too great for her strengthâ€”her
spiritual gaze was fixed.

One day toward the end of December Na thought NatÃ¡sha. He noticed her
watching him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:

â€œOne thing would be terrible,â€ said he: â€œto bind oneself forever to a
suffering man. It would be continual torture.â€ And he looked searchingly
at her. NatÃ¡sha as usual answered before she had time to think what she
would say. She said: â€œThis canâ€™t go onâ€”it wonâ€™t. You will get wellâ€”quite
well.â€

She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and reee!... thee! I love, love...â€
she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a
desperate effort....

She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her
eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.
Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a
strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now
it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the insted his soft round face.

â€œPe... PÃ©tya... Go, go, she... is calling...â€ and weeping like a child
and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost fell into
it, covering his face with his hands.

Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through NatÃ¡shaâ€™s whole being.
Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache as if
something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But the pain
was immediately followed by a feeling of releaseand tore open her
motherâ€™s dress.

â€œMy dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...â€ she whispered
incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her own
irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.

The countess pressed her daughterâ€™s hand, closed her eyes, and became
quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness,
glanced vacantly around her, and seeing NatÃ¡sha began to press her
daughterâ€™s head withd grown more
manly,â€ continued the countess, taking her daughterâ€™s hand.

â€œMamma! What are you saying...â€

â€œNatÃ¡sha, he is no more, no more!â€

And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first
time.





CHAPTER III

Princess Mary postponed her departure. SÃ³nya and the count tried to
replace NatÃ¡sha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to
restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks NatÃ¡sha
remane afternoon noticing NatÃ¡sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took
her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. NatÃ¡sha lay down,
but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she
called her back.

â€œI donâ€™t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.â€

â€œYou are tiredâ€”try to sleep.â€

â€œNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.â€

â€œShe is much better. She spoke so well today,â€ said Princess Mary.

Nincess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her
mother, her father, and her daydreams; and NatÃ¡sha, who with a passive
lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of
devotion, submission, and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice, now
feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her
past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to
her. She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her
own t to sing, and listened attentively to
herself.

She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer
of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate
young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so
cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that
it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal
from within.

At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscos left behind were among their
own people. The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleonâ€™s army was
the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the
corresponding decrease of the Russian army.

KutÃºzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the
movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian
army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at
TarÃºtino and VyÃ¡zma, to hastening it on while easingdukeâ€”it seemed that nowâ€”when any battle
must be horrible and senselessâ€”was the very time to fight and conquer
somebody. KutÃºzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after
another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those
soldiersâ€”ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starvedâ€”who within a
month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number,
and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater
distance tnd without reproach.

â€œI give you that column, lads,â€ he said, riding up to the troops and
pointing out the French to the cavalry.

And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could
scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented
to themâ€”that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,
frost-bitten, and starvingâ€”and the column that had been presented to
them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxiohad a Russian name.





CHAPTER V

In 1812 and 1813 KutÃºzov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor
was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by order
of the Highest Authorities it is said that KutÃºzov was a cunning court
liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at
KrÃ¡snoe and the BerÃ«zina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of
complete victory over the French. *

     * History of the year 1812. The so
completely accomplished as that to which all KutÃºzovâ€™s efforts were
directed in 1812.

KutÃºzov never talked of â€œforty centuries looking down from the
Pyramids,â€ of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of
what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he
said nothing about himself, adopted no pose, always appeared to be
the simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most
ordinary things. He wrote letters to hisity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim
toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of
himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real
thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood.
Beginning with the battle of BorodinÃ³, from which time his disagreement
with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of BorodinÃ³
was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatched solemnity. This KutÃºzov who before
the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in
contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that BorodinÃ³
was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was
lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after
winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat
insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought,
and that a new f what is called the battle of
KrÃ¡snoe. Toward eveningâ€”after much disputing and many mistakes made by
generals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had
been sent about with counterordersâ€”when it had become plain that the
enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no
battle, KutÃºzov left KrÃ¡snoe and went to DÃ³broe whither his headquarters
had that day been transferred.

The day was clear and frosty. KutÃºzov rode to Dthey threw at the riders and in the malevolent
expression with which, after a glance at KutÃºzov, the soldier with the
sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing.

KutÃºzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He puckered his
face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another
spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the
shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and KutÃºzov withed the French eagle he was holding before the PreobrazhÃ©nsk
standards. â€œLower, lower, thatâ€™s it. Hurrah lads!â€ he added, addressing
the men with a rapid movement of his chin.

â€œHur-r-rah!â€ roared thousands of voices.

While the soldiers were shouting KutÃºzov leaned forward in his saddle
and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic
gleam.

â€œYou see, brothers...â€ said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at
once his voiyfully and shouting â€œHurrah!â€

KutÃºzovâ€™s words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could have
repeated the field marshalâ€™s address, begun solemnly and then changing
into an old manâ€™s simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that
speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe
and consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that
old manâ€™s good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay
ies and swords, the crashing of branches,
and merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the
regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy
getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third
section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff
officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and
dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the
campfires, or watrs of the
gasping men.

â€œGet along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....â€

Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.

â€œWhat are you up to?â€ suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.
â€œThere are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you
foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, Iâ€™ll give it to you!â€ shouted he,
hitting the first man who came in his way a swingihe wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the
Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests,
and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo, called the
roll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for the nightâ€”some
repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some stripping
themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.





CHAPTER VIII

One would have thought that under the almost he soldier
they called â€œJackdaw,â€ a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose
obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into
the light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier
carrying a load of wood.

â€œBring it hereâ€”thatâ€™s fine!â€

They split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with
their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, making
the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew neag the same?â€ said an old soldier, turning
reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.

â€œWell, you know,â€ said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a
squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the
fire, â€œa plump man gets thin, but for a thin one itâ€™s death. Take
me, now! Iâ€™ve got no strength left,â€ he added, with sudden resolution
turning to the sergeant major. â€œTell them to send me to hospital; Iâ€™m
aching all o and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.â€™â€

â€œWas it from the cold?â€ asked someone.

â€œYouâ€™re a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it
had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. â€˜But,â€™ he
says, â€˜go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,â€™ he says,
â€˜we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag
them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,â€™ he says, â€˜are white as papeoldier, yawning.

The conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to sleep.

â€œLook at the stars. Itâ€™s wonderful how they shine! You would think the
women had spread out their linen,â€ said one of the men, gazing with
admiration at the Milky Way.

â€œThatâ€™s a sign of a good harvest next year.â€

â€œWe shall want some more wood.â€

â€œYou warm your back and your belly gets frozen. Thatâ€™s queer.â€

â€œO Lord!â€

â€œWhat are you pushingage our soldiers did
not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officerâ€™s hat
and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to
sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl
tied round his head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said
something, pointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen,
spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some
buckwheat porridge and vodka hile they carried him and began wailing plaintively:

â€œOh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh, my
brave, kind friends,â€ and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one
of the men like a child.

Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by
the soldiers.

Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes, was
wearing a womanâ€™s cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his
head over his cdge and Morel with a laugh set to work on
his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.
The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such
nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one
would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a
smile.

â€œThey are men too,â€ said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his
coat. â€œEven wormwood grows on its own root.â€

â€œO Lord, e of the crossing of the BerÃ«zina lies in the fact
that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for
cutting off the enemyâ€™s retreat and the soundness of the only possible
line of actionâ€”the one KutÃºzov and the general mass of the army
demandedâ€”namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled
at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to
reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossibln did that,
but they were exceptions.

Certain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope.
Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective
flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.

The farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the
remnant, especially after the BerÃ«zina, on which (in consequence of the
Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and
the keener aff reached their
maximum. KutÃºzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.
Only once, after the affair of the BerÃ«zina, did he get angry and write
to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following
letter:

â€œOn account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please
be so good as to set off for KalÃºga on receipt of this, and there await
further commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty.â€

But after Bennigsen been injured, he found old
friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had
so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army
and state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,
immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been
accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be
done in the realm of history did not concern him at all.

ChichagÃ³v, one of the most zealous â KutÃºzov to be
animated by the same desire.

KutÃºzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating
smile: â€œI meant merely to say what I said.â€

Contrary to the Emperorâ€™s wish KutÃºzov detained the greater part of the
army at VÃ­lna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack
and physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army
affairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting
the Emperoll over,
readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and,
at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh,
lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his
smooth, ingratiating voice.

The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned KutÃºzov from head to foot,
frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the
old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too, owing
to a loresence. KutÃºzov had received the Order of St. George
of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors, but
everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties
were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example,
but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and
good-for-nothing. When KutÃºzov, conforming to a custom of Catherineâ€™s
day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the
Emper
change.

With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real
strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, KonovnÃ­tsyn, and
ErmÃ³lov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field
marshalâ€™s great weakness and failing health.

His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to
another. And in fact his health was poor.

So naturally, simply, and graduallyâ€”just as he had come from Turkey to
the Treasuryiev, he fell ill and was laid up
for three months. He had what the doctors termed â€œbilious fever.â€ But
despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him
medicines to drink, he recovered.

Scarcely any impression was left on Pierreâ€™s mind by all that happened
to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered
only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical
distress, and pains in his feet and side. He rememcome accustomed to during the last few months
and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere
tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he
would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in
his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the
same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been
told after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of
his wi very absence of an aim gave him the
complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at
this time.

He could not see an aim, for he now had faithâ€”not faith in any kind of
rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever-manifest
God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for
an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity
he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what h through which he had till now gazed over menâ€™s heads, and
gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and
infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and
happy he became. That dreadful question, â€œWhat for?â€ which had formerly
destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that
question, â€œWhat for?â€ a simple answer was now always ready in his soul:
â€œBecause there is a God, that God without whosarticularly
hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after
the old countâ€™s death, now after staying a short time in OrÃ«lâ€”where she
had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she
considered it her duty to nurse himâ€”felt to her surprise and vexation
that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her
approval, he merely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt
that he regarded her with indifd
talking, or sometimes listening to Pierreâ€™s stories, and then would go
out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and
affection for him.

The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he
considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment
was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre
telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the
characters of his patients in genecy
that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.
Willarski felt dull in OrÃ«l and was pleased to meet a man of his own
circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.

But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much
behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into
apathy and egotism.

â€œYou are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,â€ he said.

But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than te contradiction, between
menâ€™s opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased
him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.

In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center
of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions,
especially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man,
he was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and
perplexity. â€œTo give or not to give?âome money of
which he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own
more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision
with regard to his wifeâ€™s debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in
and near Moscow.

His head steward came to him at OrÃ«l and Pierre reckoned up with him his
diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the
head stewardâ€™s calculation, about two million rubles.

To console Pierre for  and life; but when during his
journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like
a schoolboy on holiday. Everyoneâ€”the stagecoach driver, the post-house
overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villagesâ€”had a new
significance for him. The presence and remarks of Willarski who
continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its
backwardness compared with Eurothronged from all sides to Moscow after it had
been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first
for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in
common: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to
apply their activities there.

Within a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a
fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the
number, ever increasing and increasing, exceededfe perished, until finally all was merged into one confused, lifeless
scene of plunder.

The more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the
wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But
plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city
began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater
the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth
of the city and its regular life red things from different
houses into this or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to
keep all that was found there. They abused the police and bribed them,
made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that
had perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count RostopchÃ­n
wrote proclamations.





CHAPTER XV

At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of
his house which had not been burned. He called on a Street, he drove that same evening to see her.

On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their
friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last
one at BorodinÃ³.

â€œIs it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?
Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him
before he died?â€ thought Pierre. He recalled KaratÃ¡ev and his death and
involuntarily began to compare these two min. He spoke of you even at the very
last,â€ she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a
shyness that surprised him for an instant.

â€œI was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good
news we had received for a long time.â€

Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more
uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre
interrupted her.

â€œJust imagineâ€”I knew nothing about him!â€ shich he had not even been
thinkingâ€”especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and
enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible,
it was NatÃ¡sha and he loved her.

At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,
and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware.
He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his
agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clesee a doctor. They
insisted on her coming with me.â€

â€œYes, is there a family free from sorrow now?â€ said Pierre, addressing
NatÃ¡sha. â€œYou know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him.
What a delightful boy he was!â€

NatÃ¡sha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes
widened and lit up.

â€œWhat can one say or think of as a consolation?â€ said Pierre. â€œNothing!
Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?â€

â€œYgradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall
for her own sake.

â€œYes, yes, and so...?â€ Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with
his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. â€œYes, yes... so he
grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought
one thingâ€”to be perfectly goodâ€”so he could not be afraid of death. The
faults he hadâ€”if he had anyâ€”were not of his making. So he did soften?...
What a happy thingg.

Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside
NatÃ¡sha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of
her brotherâ€™s and NatÃ¡shaâ€™s love.

Evidently NatÃ¡sha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.

She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of
her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she
repeated the same thing twice.

Dessallesâ€™ voice was heard outside thethat feeling of awkwardness
which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is
impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is
awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like
affectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the
chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin
and, resolving to break the silence, looked at NatÃ¡sha and at Princess
Mary. They had evidently both f I must!â€

â€œTell me, you did not know of the countessâ€™ death when you decided to
remain in Moscow?â€ asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing
that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his
words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.

â€œNo,â€ answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning
Princess Mary had given to his words. â€œI heard of it in OrÃ«l and you
cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an rom that was gradually led by
Princess Maryâ€™s questions and especially by NatÃ¡shaâ€™s into giving a
detailed account of his adventures.

At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with
him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came
to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was
unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed
emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impression, but paused. By this time he had
risen from the table and was pacing the room, NatÃ¡sha following him with
her eyes. Then he added:

â€œNo, you canâ€™t understand what I learned from that illiterate manâ€”that
simple fellow.â€

â€œYes, yes, go on!â€ said NatÃ¡sha. â€œWhere is he?â€

â€œThey killed him almost before my eyes.â€

And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last
days of their retreat, of KaratÃ¡evâ€™s illness and his death to look at him intently
with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand
something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced
and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what
to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It
occurred to none of them that it was three oâ€™clock and time to go to
bed.

â€œPeople speak of misfortunes and sufferings,â€ remarked Pierre, â€œbut if
at this  our feelings, we forget him.â€

Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of
NatÃ¡shaâ€™s remark, but she did not express agreement in words.

â€œIs it possible to forget?â€ said she.

â€œIt did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and
painful, but good, very good!â€ said NatÃ¡sha. â€œI am sure he really loved
him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?â€ she added, suddenly
blushing.

â€œTo tell Pierre? Oh, yes.ix in the morning and he still paced up and down the
room.

â€œWell, whatâ€™s to be done if it cannot be avoided? Whatâ€™s to be done?
Evidently it has to be so,â€ said he to himself, and hastily undressing
he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or
indecision.

â€œStrange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything
that she and I may be man and wife,â€ he told himself.

A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Peter. You must forgive
the trouble I have put you to,â€ said Pierre, and seeing SavÃ©lich smile,
he thought: â€œBut how strange it is that he should not know that now
there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of
all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall
I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?â€ Pierre reflected. â€œNo,
another time.â€

At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to
s
Thatâ€™s the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a
kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me.â€

Pierre went to Princess Maryâ€™s to dinner.

As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned
down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness
of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters
of the town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of
the Rhine that house, by the
evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from
one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long
that Princess Mary and NatÃ¡sha exchanged glances, evidently wondering
when he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy
and embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take
his leave.

Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of
a headbegan to love her, but I have loved her and her
alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without
her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that
perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that
possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?
Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!â€ he added after a pause, and
touched her hand as she did not reply.

â€œI am thinking of what you have told me,€

Next day Pierre came to say good-by. NatÃ¡sha was less animated than
she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre
sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she
existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. â€œIs it possible?
No, it canâ€™t be,â€ he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that
filled his soul with joy.

When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help
holding it whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong.
Only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: â€œWasnâ€™t it all
a dream? Isnâ€™t Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and
self-confident? I believe all thisâ€”and suddenly Princess Mary will tell
her, and she will be sure to smile and say: â€˜How strange! He must be
deluding himself. Doesnâ€™t he know that he is a man, just a man, while
I...? I am something altogether different and higher.â€™â€

That smile and surprise
people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everybodyâ€”both
those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that
is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not
understand itâ€”in the bright light of the emotion that shone within
himself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met
everything that was good and worthy of being loved.

When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wi his hair
cropped,â€ something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepressible,
awoke in NatÃ¡shaâ€™s soul.

Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.
To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the
surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to have
forgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer complained of her
position, did not say a word about the past, and no longer feared to
make happyment. She remembered her brother and his
love.

â€œBut whatâ€™s to be done? She canâ€™t help it,â€ thought the princess.

And with a sad and rather stern look she told NatÃ¡sha all that Pierre
had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg NatÃ¡sha was
astounded.

â€œTo Petersburg!â€ she repeated as if unable to understand.

But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Maryâ€™s face she guessed
the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.

â€res were not
borne by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed
to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies,
who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars,
campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political
and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.

The historians call this activity of the historical figures â€œthe
reaction.â€

In dealing with this period they sternly cons good for
humanity.

What do these reproaches mean?

Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I
(the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with
Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)
flow from the same sourcesâ€”the circumstances of his birth, education,
and lifeâ€”that made his personality what it was and from which the
actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoratioer, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what
once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is
more, we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to
what is bad and what is good in history: some people regard giving a
constitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in
Alexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.

The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or
harvailed in
the governmentâ€”an activity that in the opinion of the historians was
good and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would
have been no life, there would have been nothing.

If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of
life is destroyed.





CHAPTER II

If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the
attainment of certain endsâ€”the greatness of Russia or of France,
the balance of p understand why this occurs and I talk of
genius.

To a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a
special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others
must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction
of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram,
who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a
special enclosure where there are oatsâ€”that this very ram, swelling wconsider them to
be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have
recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made
these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small
events were inevitable.

By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall
clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for
any single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is
impossiblditions, without
a name, and not even a Frenchman, emergesâ€”by what seem the strangest
chancesâ€”from among all the seething French parties, and without joining
anyone of them is borne forward to a prominent position.

The ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of
his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and
self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the
army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers oader, assure themselves
that this is admirable, this is gloryâ€”it resembles Caesar and Alexander
the Great and is therefore good.

This ideal of glory and grandeurâ€”which consists not merely in
considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every
crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural
significanceâ€”that ideal, destined to guide this man and his associates,
had scope for its development in Africa. Whatever he does succhim. But the once proud
and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are
even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have
said to destroy him and retain their power.

Chance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by
agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the characters
of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character
of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government;ormed relations with all
the crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the world can
oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of
glory and grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their
insignificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek
the great manâ€™s mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that
this man receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the
guardian of all that the nationsnces are now
not for Napoleon but always against him.

A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.
Attempted drives from east to westâ€”similar to the contrary movements of
1805, 1807, and 1809â€”precede the great westward movement; there is the
same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion
of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitating
does not come from the quarter they expect. It rises again from the same
point as beforeâ€”Paris. The last backwash of the movement from the west
occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable
diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of
history.

The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any
conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by
strange chance no one does so ana personal grievance against
Napoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been
prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education,
his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by
Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.

During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. But
as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he
appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the natioing from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the
fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from
flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey.
Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely
says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear
a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices
that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pi and enterprising.

The arrangements for NatÃ¡shaâ€™s marriage occupied him for a while. He
ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but
his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it
evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.

When Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to
complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his
bed. He realized from the first that he wo of small
debts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amounted to
double the value of the property.

Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But
he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his fatherâ€™s memory, which he
held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the
inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.

The creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague
but powerful  SÃ³nya to a small
house on the SÃ­vtsev VrazhÃ³k.

NatÃ¡sha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no
clear idea of Nicholasâ€™ circumstances. Having borrowed money from his
brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him.
His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve
hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and SÃ³nya,
but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. Thesee no way out of this situation. The idea of
marrying some rich woman, which was suggested to him by his female
relations, was repugnant to him. The other way outâ€”his motherâ€™s
deathâ€”never entered his head. He wished for nothing and hoped
for nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern
satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position. He tried
to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive
offers of assistance; h her again,
and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom.
To her remarks about his motherâ€™s health he made no reply. â€œWhatâ€™s that
to you? Leave me in peace,â€ his looks seemed to say.

â€œWhy does she come prowling here? What does she want? I canâ€™t bear these
ladies and all these civilities!â€ said he aloud in SÃ³nyaâ€™s presence,
evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princessâ€™ carriage
had disappeared.

â€œOh, Ni and now I wonâ€™t interfere any more since you
have secrets from your mother.â€

â€œWell, then, Iâ€™ll go if you wish it.â€

â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.â€

Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a
patience, trying to divert his motherâ€™s attention to another topic.

The same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the
day after that.

After her visit to the RostÃ³vs and her unexpectedlyntessâ€™ health, of their mutual friends, of the
latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had
elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.

With Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s help the princess had maintained the
conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose,
she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her
mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little
happinrds which would explain his feeling for her.

â€œYes, yes,â€ said she, â€œbut you have no reason to regret the past, Count.
As I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it
with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now...â€

â€œI cannot accept your praise,â€ he interrupted her hurriedly. â€œOn the
contrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an
interesting or cheerful subject.â€

His face again resumed iu wish to deprive me of our former
friendship. And that hurts me.â€ There were tears in her eyes and in her
voice. â€œI have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard
for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!â€ and suddenly she began to cry
and was hurrying from the room.

â€œPrincess, for Godâ€™s sake!â€ he exclaimed, trying to stop her.
â€œPrincess!â€

She turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one
anotherâ€™s eyesâ€”and what had sorer. When Nicholas first began farming
and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who
especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely
a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first
he watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they
considered good and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give
orders while in reality learning from them their methods, their manner
of speech, and the said he spoiled them by his laxity. When
a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one
had to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in
the house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted
instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He
never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his
every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.

st in. She did not understand
why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his
mustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall
on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind
carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return
from the barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of
wormwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would
say: â€œWell, one moridly; serfs from neighboring estates came
to beg him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his
administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs. â€œHe was a
master... the peasantsâ€™ affairs first and then his own. Of course he was
not to be trifled with eitherâ€”in a word, he was a real master!â€





CHAPTER VIII

One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas, and
that was his quick temper together with his old hussar hacquired an irresistible charm.

The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself
and began to cry.

â€œNicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!â€ and
she covered her face with her hands.

Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up
and down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could
not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded
from childhood as quitee!â€ he would say. â€œI deserve it.â€

â€œYou should go, go away at once, if you donâ€™t feel strong enough to
control yourself,â€ she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.

Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked.
He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and
consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The
whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work
oy and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will
toward her which she could not overcome.

Once she had a talk with her friend NatÃ¡sha about SÃ³nya and about her
own injustice toward her.

â€œYou know,â€ said NatÃ¡sha, â€œyou have read the Gospels a great dealâ€”there
is a passage in them that just fits SÃ³nya.â€

â€œWhat?â€ asked Countess Mary, surprised.

â€œâ€˜To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be
taken away.â€™ You remel floors and was furnished with
very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own
serf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious
and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole
families of the RostÃ³vsâ€™ and BolkÃ³nskisâ€™ relations sometimes came to
Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for
months. Besides that, four times a year, on the name days and birthdays
of the hosts, as ons against the general
drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saintâ€™s
day, he returned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk
with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at
which the whole household had assembled. At that table were his mother,
his motherâ€™s old lady companion BelÃ³va, his wife, their three children
with their governess and tutor, his wifeâ€™s nephew with his tutor, SÃ³nya,
DenÃ­sov, NatWhen they left the table
and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her
hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.

â€œYou always have such strange fancies! I didnâ€™t even think of being
angry,â€ he replied.

But the word always seemed to her to imply: â€œYes, I am angry but I wonâ€™t
tell you why.â€

Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even SÃ³nya and the
old countess, who felt jealous and wou at â€œgoing to Moscowâ€ in a carriage made of
chairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with
them a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable
crossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with
difficulty, went to the small sitting room.

â€œPerhaps he is not asleep; Iâ€™ll have an explanation with him,â€ she
said to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,
followed her on tiptoe. She did not non to look and did not notice... forgive me....â€

Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the
door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little
black-eyed three-year-old NatÃ¡sha, her fatherâ€™s pet, having learned from
her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran
to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly
opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic st. always...
and now... in this cond...â€

â€œOh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, itâ€™s love that
makes us see beauty. It is only MalvÃ­nas and women of that kind who are
loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I donâ€™t love her, but...
I donâ€™t know how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between
us like this, I seem lost and canâ€™t do anything. Now do I love my
finger? I donâ€™t love it, but just try to cut it off!â€

â€œent they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in
the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.

â€œSomebody has come.â€

â€œI am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,â€ said Countess Mary and left
the room.

In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a
gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly
from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded
him of dancing, and looking at tm, soft,
and serene expression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing
animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm.
Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was
not visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and
fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That
happened only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home,
or a sick child was convalescent, or when s
surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood
NatÃ¡sha, and she kept saying that she had always known that NatÃ¡sha
would make an exemplary wife and mother.

â€œOnly she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all
bounds,â€ said the countess, â€œso that it even becomes absurd.â€

NatÃ¡sha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,
especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself
go when she moting no time either to singing, to dress, or
to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these
things.

We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in
a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so
trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if oneâ€™s entire
attention is devoted to it.

The subject which wholly engrossed NatÃ¡shaâ€™s attention was her family:
that is, her husband whom she  perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his
purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.

If the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have
many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that
case will not have a family.

If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the
family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one
can digest, and not having more wives or huâ€™s demands astonished him, but they also flattered him,
and he submitted to them.

Pierreâ€™s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not
flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did
not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a
whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on
businessâ€”in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which
she did not in the least undersd, that to have a wet
nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite
the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband
himselfâ€”who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself,
a thing then unheard of and considered injuriousâ€”she insisted on having
her own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.

It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife
would have a dispute, but long aft reading the letter she
replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return.
He was given four weeksâ€™ leave of absence.

Ever since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight
before, NatÃ¡sha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and
irritability.

DenÃ­sov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with
the present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He
looked at NatÃ¡sha with sorrow andf Pierreâ€™s sleigh was heard
at the front door, and the old nurseâ€”knowing how to please her
mistressâ€”entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming
face.

â€œHas he come?â€ NatÃ¡sha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest
she should rouse the dozing baby.

â€œHeâ€™s come, maâ€™am,â€ whispered the nurse.

The blood rushed to NatÃ¡shaâ€™s face and her feet involuntarily moved, but
she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened hihad
experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her
face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of
reproaches and angry words.

â€œYes, itâ€™s all very well for you. You are pleased, youâ€™ve had a good
time.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration
for the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... PÃ©tya was at
deathâ€™s door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, enjoying...â€

Pierre knew s. But
in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby
with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his
attention.

â€œHow sweet!â€ said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the baby.
â€œNow, Nicholas,â€ she added, turning to her husband, â€œI canâ€™t understand
how it is you donâ€™t see the charm of these delicious marvels.â€

â€œI donâ€™t and canâ€™t,â€ replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby. â€œA
lump of glad of Pierreâ€™s return because
no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did.
He alone could play on the clavichord that Ã©cossaise (his only piece)
to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt
sure he had brought presents for them all.

Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent,
with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because
Uncle Pierre as he called him was the obs only just
beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had
loved NatÃ¡sha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father
whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not
be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and
tears of sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had
arrived.

The guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite
any company he waties) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now
added stinginess.

From the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing
entailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he
spent only half as much as before, and that his affairsâ€”which had been
in disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wifeâ€™s debtsâ€”had begun
to improve.

Life was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive
luxury, the kind of life that can bierre and NatÃ¡sha came into the drawing
room with parcels under their arms.

The countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a
frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip
had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.

After the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she
felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
without aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept
awakee would mutter
angrily: â€œO Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!â€

Another pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp
or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face
would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when BelÃ³va
would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countessâ€™ face yellow. Just
as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise
her still-existing faculty of thinkingâ€”andntess was in
one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of
playing patience, and soâ€”though by force of habit she greeted him with
the words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an
absence: â€œHigh time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting
for you. Well, thank God!â€ and received her presents with another
customary remark: â€œItâ€™s not the gift thatâ€™s precious, my dear, but that
you give it to me, an old woman dropped so
far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her
presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to
repeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was
dead and so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to
rememberâ€”yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from
habit, and Pierre answered the countessâ€™ questions as to whether Prince
VasÃ­li had aged and whether Countess Mao be the only serious and real society. NatÃ¡sha saw by
Pierreâ€™s animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had
much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess. DenÃ­sov,
not being a member of the family, did not understand Pierreâ€™s caution
and being, as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in
Petersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in
the SemÃ«novsk regiment, then about ArakchÃ©ev, and then abosevere expression sailed back to her table in the sitting
room.

The melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the
childrenâ€™s voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly
excitement was going on there.

â€œFinished, finished!â€ little NatÃ¡shaâ€™s gleeful yell rose above them all.

Pierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (NatÃ¡sha he
never lost sight of) and smiled happily.

â€œThatâ€™s delightful music!â€ say good night. They kissed
everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out.
Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the
boy to come downstairs.

â€œNo, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,â€ replied
Nicholas BolkÃ³nski also in a whisper.

â€œMa tante, please let me stay,â€ said he, going up to his aunt.

His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary
glanced at him and turned sburg
which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what
Pierre told them.

â€œOne used to have to be a Germanâ€”now one must dance with TatÃ¡winova
and Madame KwÃ¼dener, and wead Eckaâ€™tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they
should let that fine fellow Bonaparte looseâ€”heâ€™d knock all this nonsense
out of them! Fancy giving the command of the SemÃ«nov wegiment to a
fellow like that Schwaâ€™tz!â€ he cried.

Nicholas, though free from DenÃ­sovâ€se her baby, now
heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary
followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas BolkÃ³nski
followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table
in a shady corner by the window.

â€œWell, what would you do?â€ asked DenÃ­sov.

â€œAlways some fantastic schemes,â€ said Nicholas.

â€œWhy this,â€ began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,
sometimes stopping short, gesticulatinnt circumstances something else is needed.â€

At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face
darkened and he went up to the boy.

â€œWhy are you here?â€

â€œWhy? Let him be,â€ said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and
continuing. â€œThat is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed.
When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment,
when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as
possible musce of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ
preached on the Cross.â€

NatÃ¡sha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at
her husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased herâ€”that did not
even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple
and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she
knew that it sprang from Pierreâ€™s whole soul), but it was his animated
and enthusiastic appearance€œI will tell you this,â€ he said, rising and trying with nervously
twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally
abandoning the attempt. â€œI canâ€™t prove it to you. You say that
everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I donâ€™t
see it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional
matter, and to that I reply: â€˜You are my best friend, as you know,
but if you formed a secret society and began working against the
gAll right, all right,â€ he said, throwing the bits under the table.

And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned away
from the boy.

â€œYou ought not to have been here at all,â€ he said.





CHAPTER XV

The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, but
turned on the subject Nicholas liked bestâ€”recollections of 1812. DenÃ­sov
started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about
them. The family separagain began
crying piteously and kissing me. One can do anything with him by
tenderness.


â€œWhat is a â€˜ticketâ€™?â€ Nicholas inquired.

â€œI have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how
they have behaved.â€

Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and
continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down
everything in the childrenâ€™s lives that seemed noteworthy to their
mother as showing their cha not only belonged to him but was part of
himself.

â€œI quite, quite approve, my dearest!â€ said he with a significant look,
and after a short pause he added: â€œAnd I behaved badly today. You
werenâ€™t in the study. We began disputingâ€”Pierre and Iâ€”and I lost my
temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I donâ€™t know what would
become of him if NatÃ¡sha didnâ€™t keep him in hand.... Have you any idea
why he went to Petersburg? They have formed...â€

â€œYest! Thatâ€™s just what I said to him,â€ put in Nicholas, who
fancied he really had said it. â€œBut they insisted on their own view:
love of oneâ€™s neighbor and Christianityâ€”and all this in the presence of
young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.â€

â€œAh, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,â€
said Countess Mary. â€œHe is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I
neglect him in favor of my own: we all have childr you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own
pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?
No, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, and not
to leave the children such beggars as I was.â€

Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone
and that he attached too much importance to these matters. But she knew
she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only
took his hanount of the boyâ€™s agitation while Pierre was speaking
struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive
character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she
thought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but
compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt
with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young
Nicholas.

Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the¡sha came up to him with
wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her
bosom, saying: â€œNow you are all mine, mine! You wonâ€™t escape!â€â€”from that
moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and
contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at
one and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics did
not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest
sign that they fus: the
recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and
he wanted to know what NatÃ¡sha thought of it.

â€œNicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally
accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line,â€
said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.

â€œNo, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are
an amusementâ€”almost a pastime,â€ said Pierre. â€œFor instance, he is
col
society be also my husband? How did this happen?â€ She wished to express
this doubt to him. â€œNow who could decide whether he is really cleverer
than all the others?â€ she asked herself, and passed in review all those
whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one
he had respected so highly as PlatÃ³n KaratÃ¡ev.

â€œDo you know what I am thinking about?â€ she asked. â€œAbout PlatÃ³n
KaratÃ¡ev. Would he have approved of you now, do you thsay it! I canâ€™t bear it!â€ NatÃ¡sha cried, and her eyes glittered
coldly and vindictively. â€œDid you see her?â€ she added, after a pause.

â€œNo, and if I had I shouldnâ€™t have recognized her.â€

They were silent for a while.

â€œOh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at
you,â€ NatÃ¡sha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had
come over them. â€œYou are as like him as two peasâ€”like the boy.â€ (She
meant her littlnstairs in young Nicholas BolkÃ³nskiâ€™s bedroom a little lamp
was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark and they could
not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his
Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring. Little Nicholas, who had
just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him
with wide-open eyes. He had awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed
that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as weill do it. Mucius Scaevola burned
his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know
they want me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have
finished learning, and then I will do something. I only pray God that
something may happen to me such as happened to Plutarchâ€™s men, and I
will act as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me,
and be delighted with me!â€ And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and
he began to cry.nâ€™s
subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations
are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but
the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having
in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them
in practice.

Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by
the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with
extraordinary, superhuch men, while another
includes also orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets).
Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led
is known to the historians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of
the Roman, Spanish, or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality,
and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called
Europe.

In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed
by reply
would have been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve
in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in
it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that
period, nor would there have been any contradictions.

But modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the
conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity
in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other ansed and again began killing many
people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured
Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor
Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to
arm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleonâ€™s allies suddenly
became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he
raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to
abdicate, and sent his is ironicâ€”a caricature of the
historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of
the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, which all the
historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories
of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new
histories of the culture of that period.

The strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that
modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions nonations?

Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand
this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration
events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in
general of the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind
of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are
satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event.
As soon as historians of different nation.

According to this view the power of historical personages, represented
as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded
as a force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal
historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself
produces events, and treat it as their cause. In their exposition, an
historic character is first the product of his time, and his power only
the resultant of various forces, and then hit the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this
opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of
1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside
Alexanderâ€™s willâ€”such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de
StaÃ«l, Talleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian
evidently decomposes Alexanderâ€™s power into the components: Talleyrand,
Chateaubriand, and the restâ€”but the sum of the components,  of
cultureâ€”following the path laid down by the universal historians who
sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing eventsâ€”again
take that force to be something quite different. They see it in what is
called cultureâ€”in mental activity.

The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their
progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical
events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one
another in suer with other influences was the cause
of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat Social, had the effect of making
Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an
explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event.

Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously,
and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual
activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a
connection may be such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they
involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of powerâ€”and say
plainly that that was the result of Napoleonâ€™s will. Speaking so, the
historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that
the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in
history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power
which they apparently do not recognize.





CHAPTER III
 with the whole movement of the peoples.

Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement
observed. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the
peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting
from several other forces, like the movement of the wheels; others again
as an intellectual influence, like the smoke that is blown away.

So long as historiesrsâ€™ will be interesting and instructive and may
perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real
value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much
of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also
doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because
too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart
someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?â€”that is, wantsthat manâ€™s will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions
take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return
to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human
affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing
historical events and termed â€œpower.â€

A return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and
so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.

Napoleon orderedion to the people of the man who wields the power.

And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence,
that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historyâ€™s
understanding of power for true gold.

Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or
tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.

In the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a
state and power might be arranged were it possible for all tce with the French went to
fight the Austrians?

To these questions three answers are possible:

Either to assume (1) that the will of the people is always
unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and
that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle
against the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an
infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the people
is transferred to the rulers conditionallyand
struggle with one anotherâ€”that a Legitimist historian will prove
that the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere
infringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will
prove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the
real power, and that all the others were violations of power.
Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually
contradictory can only satisfy young children.

Reco. Equally
little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective
will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and
then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the
Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII,
to Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican
government, and to Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers
of the peopleâ€™s will from one individual to anot the
historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have
those leaders?

The leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people:
the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.

But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
leaders serves as an expression of the peopleâ€™s will or only some part
of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of
the peopleâ€™s will, as sof humanity is only based
on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is
always transferred to the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the
activity of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture,
and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the
activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses, practice
agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.

History proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the and reformers explain to us the
life of the peoples.

The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of
life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had
a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was
suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after
the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the
French Revolution they guillotined one another.

If we unite bothg of the herdsman, should attribute
the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.

â€œThe herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads
it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that
leader.â€ This is what historians of the first class sayâ€”those who assume
the unconditional transference of the peopleâ€™s will.

â€œIf the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the
collective will of all rson? On
condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That
is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which
we do not understand.

If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,
then having subjected to criticism the explanation of â€œpowerâ€ that
juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely
a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man
has, besides abcan be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men.
On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the cause
of events, history shows that the expression of the will of historical
personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that is to say,
their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very opposite
of what they order occurs.

Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we
cannot regard â€œpowerâ€ as thuted without some preceding order having been given
rendering the execution of the last command possible.

No command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series
of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers
to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.

When, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war,
we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive
commande of
events remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get linked up with a
consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events, and
are executed.

Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes
it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of
thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that
event have been executed, we forget about the others that were not
executed because they could nin what this dependence consists it is necessary to
reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from
the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the command
himself takes part in the event.

This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is
called power. This relation consists in the following:

For common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which
regardless of the difference of the aims set ers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less
frequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An
officer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more
frequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the
objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief
never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general
orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A sVII

When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes
about it, and as the event results from the collective activity of
many people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be
fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions expressed
is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command
preceding it.

Men are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to how and
where to haul it. They haul theurope, and so on. Men went
from the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event
was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of
England, and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the
events have no common sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of
killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing
of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these
justifications have a very necesasioned by the forward movement of the ship,
and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were
imperceptibly moving.

We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical
characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that
occursâ€”the continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the
essential connection of historical persons with the masses.

When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the er is the relation of a given person to other individuals,
in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and
justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is
his participation in that action.

(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual
activity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have
supposed, but by the activity of all the people who participate in
the events, and who always combine fice and we should have finished our
argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter
cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion
and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history,
says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.

The presence of the problem of manâ€™s free will, though unexpressed, is
felt at every step of history.

All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily consciousness does he know himself.

Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason
is conceivable.

To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be
conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as
a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of
his volition. But his willâ€”which forms the essence of his lifeâ€”man
recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.

If, observing him
Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls
downwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law
that he has learned to be fulfilled.

But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does
not and cannot believe this.

However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as
before, yet when under the same conditions and with teedom, uncontrolled by
experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone
without exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man
is possible constitutes the other side of the question.

Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God.
What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of
manâ€™s freedom? That is a question for theology.

The actions of men are subject to general immutable lawul and
free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang
from the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that thousands of
years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now
trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely
acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers, but has never
been denied. They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in
this matter is merely to serve as an instrumeef
superintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over the
windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should be
delighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything is now
so smooth and regular.





CHAPTER IX

For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history
has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the
question is dealt with, that for history this question does not referactivity of many men or of an individual
we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of manâ€™s free
will and partly of the law of inevitability.

Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions
of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someoneâ€™s
action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his
walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and
inevitability governing the acnsiders his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who
examined it the day after it was committed. And in the same way every
action of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less
free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him
who committed the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one
who does not know it. In all these cases the conception of freedom
is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsio us free. But if we see his relation
to anything around him, if we see his connection with anything
whateverâ€”with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on
which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that
falls on the things about himâ€”we see that each of these circumstances
has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity.
And the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of
his freedom dimind that action not been performed. The farther I go back
in memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my
judgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my
action.

In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning
the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A
contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the
known participants, but with a more remote event we already see itsis controlled,
and the more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological,
and historical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are
observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in
question, the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our
actions and those of others appear.

When we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a
crime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a
grethe
son of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen
into bad company, a drunkardâ€™s relapse into drunkenness, and so on are
actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause.
If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of
mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpletonâ€”then,
knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and
intelligence in question, we see so large an eleme beyond our ken, we get the conception of a minimum of
inevitability and a maximum of freedom.

In neither caseâ€”however we may change our point of view, however plain
we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external
world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short the
period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes
of the action may beâ€”can we ever conceive either complete freedom or
complete necessity.n
lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting,
nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me. The
moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, and at that
moment I could make only one movement, and whatever movement I made
would be the only one. That I did not lift my arm a moment later does
not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then. And since I
could make only one movement at that single momen be complete, for the
number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And
therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined,
there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom
remains.

(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are
examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while
time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute
inevitabiliility we
should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and
cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would
be nothing, or mere content without form.

We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which manâ€™s
whole outlook on the universe is constructedâ€”the incomprehensible
essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.

Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it
visibility is infintability, that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason.

All that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of
life to the laws of reason.

The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of
them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal
force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and
we call that freedom.

But just aence of the forces of heat and electricity, or
of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of
astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the
same way does the force of free will form the content of history.
But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this
unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the
subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free will
in human beingaction is due to free will, then not a single historical law
can exist, nor any conception of historical events.

For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end
of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
consciousness of manâ€™s will in the present moves in space, time, and
dependence on cause.

The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more
evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define thoe proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say
that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all
bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting
one another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the
movement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies
from the infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by
the natural sciences: leaving aside the questioneem impossible to continue
studying historic events as the results of manâ€™s free will. For if a
certain mode of government was established or certain migrations
of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic,
ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those
individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government
or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.

And yet the former history continuhe law of
inevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil,
and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on
those conceptions.

So too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of
inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though
the law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in
astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation on which
the institutions once a freedom
that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not
conscious.
